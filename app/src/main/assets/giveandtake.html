<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:447.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they struck up a conversation about work. The taller of the two men was Danny Shader, a serial</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:465.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">entrepreneur who had spent time at Netscape, Motorola, and Amazon. Intense, dark-haired, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:483.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">capable of talking about business forever, Shader was in his late thirties by the time he launched his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:501.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">first company, and he liked to call himself the “old man of the Internet.” He loved building</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">companies, and he was just getting his fourth start-up off the ground.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:537.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Shader had instantly taken a liking to the other father, a man named David Hornik who invests in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:555.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">companies for a living. At 5'4", with dark hair, glasses, and a goatee, Hornik is a man of eclectic</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:591.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">computer music. He went on to earn a master’s in criminology and a law degree, and after burning the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:609.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">midnight oil at a law firm, he accepted a job offer to join a venture capital firm, where he spent the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:627.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">next decade listening to pitches from entrepreneurs and deciding whether or not to fund them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:645.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">During a break between soccer games, Shader turned to Hornik and said, “I’m working on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:663.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something—do you want to see a pitch?” Hornik specialized in Internet companies, so he seemed like</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:681.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">an ideal investor to Shader. The interest was mutual. Most people who pitch ideas are first-time</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:699.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">entrepreneurs, with no track record of success. In contrast, Shader was a blue-chip entrepreneur who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:717.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had hit the jackpot not once, but twice. In 1999, his first start-up, Accept.com, was acquired by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:735.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Amazon for $175 million. In 2007, his next company, Good Technology, was acquired by Motorola</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:753.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for $500 million. Given Shader’s history, Hornik was eager to hear what he was up to next.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:3.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A few days after the soccer game, Shader drove to Hornik’s office and pitched his newest idea.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Nearly a quarter of Americans have trouble making online purchases because they don’t have a bank</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">account or credit card, and Shader was proposing an innovative solution to this problem. Hornik was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one of the first venture capitalists to hear the pitch, and right off the bat, he loved it. Within a week, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">put Shader in front of his partners and offered him a term sheet: he wanted to fund Shader’s company.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Although Hornik had moved fast, Shader was in a strong position. Given Shader’s reputation, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the quality of his idea, Hornik knew plenty of investors would be clamoring to work with Shader.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“You’re rarely the only investor giving an entrepreneur a term sheet,” Hornik explains. “You’re</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">competing with the best venture capital firms in the country, and trying to convince the entrepreneur to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">take your money instead of theirs.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The best way for Hornik to land the investment was to set a deadline for Shader to make his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">decision. If Hornik made a compelling offer with a short fuse, Shader might sign it before he had the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chance to pitch to other investors. This is what many venture capitalists do to stack the odds in their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">favor.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But Hornik didn’t give Shader a deadline. In fact, he practically invited Shader to shop his offer</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around to other investors. Hornik believed that entrepreneurs need time to evaluate their options, so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as a matter of principle, he refused to present exploding offers. “Take as much time as you need to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">make the right decision,” he said. Although Hornik hoped Shader would conclude that the right</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">decision was to sign with him, he put Shader’s best interests ahead of his own, giving Shader space to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">explore other options.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Shader did just that: he spent the next few weeks pitching his idea to other investors. In the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">meantime, Hornik wanted to make sure he was still a strong contender, so he sent Shader his most</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">valuable resource: a list of forty references who could attest to Hornik’s caliber as an investor.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hornik knew that entrepreneurs look for the same attributes in investors that we all seek in financial</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advisers: competence and trustworthiness. When entrepreneurs sign with an investor, the investor</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">joins their board of directors and provides expert advice. Hornik’s list of references reflected the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blood, sweat, and tears that he had devoted to entrepreneurs over the course of more than a decade in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the venture business. He knew they would vouch for his skill and his character.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A few weeks later, Hornik’s phone rang. It was Shader, ready to announce his decision.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“I’m sorry,” Shader said, “but I’m signing with another investor.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The financial terms of the offer from Hornik and the other investor were virtually identical, so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hornik’s list of forty references should have given him an advantage. And after speaking with the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">references, it was clear to Shader that Hornik was a great guy.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But it was this very same spirit of generosity that doomed Hornik’s case. Shader worried that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hornik would spend more time encouraging him than challenging him. Hornik might not be tough</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enough to help Shader start a successful business, and the other investor had a reputation for being a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">brilliant adviser who questioned and pushed entrepreneurs. Shader walked away thinking, “I should</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">probably add somebody to the board who will challenge me more. Hornik is so affable that I don’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">know what he’ll be like in the boardroom.” When he called Hornik, he explained, “My heart said to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">go with you, but my head said to go with them. I decided to go with my head instead of my heart.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hornik was devastated, and he began to second-guess himself. “Am I a dope? If I had applied</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pressure to take the term sheet, maybe he would have taken it. But I’ve spent a decade building my</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:346.50px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Takers </span><span class="cls_004">have a distinctive signature: they like to get more than they give. They tilt reciprocity in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their own favor, putting their own interests ahead of others’ needs. Takers believe that the world is a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:382.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">competitive, dog-eat-dog place. They feel that to succeed, they need to be better than others. To prove</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:400.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their competence, they self-promote and make sure they get plenty of credit for their efforts. Garden-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:418.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">variety takers aren’t cruel or cutthroat; they’re just cautious and self-protective. “If I don’t look out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:436.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for myself first,” takers think, “no one will.” Had David Hornik been more of a taker, he would have</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:454.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">given Danny Shader a deadline, putting his goal of landing the investment ahead of Shader’s desire</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:472.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for a flexible timeline.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:490.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But Hornik is the opposite of a taker; he’s a </span><span class="cls_005">giver</span><span class="cls_004">. In the workplace, givers are a relatively rare</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:508.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">breed. They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get. Whereas</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:526.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other people can offer them, givers are other-focused,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:544.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">paying more attention to what other people need from them. These preferences aren’t about money:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:562.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">givers and takers aren’t distinguished by how much they donate to charity or the compensation that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:580.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they command from their employers. Rather, givers and takers differ in their attitudes and actions</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:598.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">toward other people. If you’re a taker, you help others strategically, when the benefits to </span><span class="cls_005">you</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:616.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">outweigh the personal costs. If you’re a giver, you might use a different cost-benefit analysis: you help</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:634.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">whenever the benefits to </span><span class="cls_005">others </span><span class="cls_004">exceed the personal costs. Alternatively, you might not think about the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:652.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">personal costs at all, helping others without expecting anything in return. If you’re a giver at work,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">you simply strive to be generous in sharing your time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:688.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">connections with other people who can benefit from them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:706.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It’s tempting to reserve the giver label for larger-than-life heroes such as Mother Teresa or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:724.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mahatma Gandhi, but being a giver doesn’t require extraordinary acts of sacrifice. It just involves a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:742.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">focus on acting in the interests of others, such as by giving help, providing mentoring, sharing credit,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:760.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">or making connections for others. Outside the workplace, this type of behavior is quite common.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:3.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">According to research led by Yale psychologist Margaret Clark, </span><span class="cls_028">most people act like givers in close</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">relationships</span><span class="cls_004">. In marriages and friendships, we contribute whenever we can without keeping score.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But in the workplace, give and take becomes more complicated. Professionally, few of us act</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">purely like givers or takers, adopting a third style instead. We become </span><span class="cls_005">matchers</span><span class="cls_004">, striving</span><span class="cls_005"> </span><span class="cls_004">to preserve</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">an equal balance of giving and getting. Matchers operate on the principle of fairness: when they help</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity. If you’re a matcher, you believe in tit for tat,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and your relationships are governed by even exchanges of favors.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Giving, taking, and matching are three fundamental styles of social interaction, but the lines</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">between them aren’t hard and fast. You might find that you shift from one reciprocity style to another</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as you travel across different work roles and relationships.</span><span class="cls_028">*</span><span class="cls_004"> It wouldn’t be surprising if you act like a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">taker when negotiating your salary, a giver when mentoring someone with less experience than you,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and a matcher when sharing expertise with a colleague. But evidence shows that at work, the vast</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">majority of people develop a primary reciprocity style, which captures how they approach most of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the people most of the time. And this primary style can play as much of a role in our success as hard</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">work, talent, and luck.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In fact, the patterns of success based on reciprocity styles are remarkably clear. If I asked you to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guess who’s the most likely to end up at the bottom of the success ladder, what would you say—</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers, givers, or matchers?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Professionally, all three reciprocity styles have their own benefits and drawbacks. But there’s one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">style that proves more costly than the other two. Based on David Hornik’s story, you might predict</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that givers achieve the worst results—and you’d be right. Research demonstrates that givers sink to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the bottom of the success ladder. Across a wide range of important occupations, givers are at a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">disadvantage: they make others better off but sacrifice their own success in the process.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the </span><span class="cls_028">world of engineering</span><span class="cls_004">, the least productive and effective engineers are givers. In one study,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">when more than 160 professional engineers in California rated one another on help given and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">received, the least successful engineers were those who gave more than they received. These givers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had the worst objective scores in their firm for the number of tasks, technical reports, and drawings</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">completed—not to mention errors made, deadlines missed, and money wasted. Going out of their way</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to help others prevented them from getting their own work done.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The same pattern emerges in medical school. In a study of more than six hundred </span><span class="cls_028">medical students</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">in Belgium</span><span class="cls_004">, the students with the lowest grades had unusually high scores on giver statements like “I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">love to help others” and “I anticipate the needs of others.” The givers went out of their way to help</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their peers study, sharing what they already knew at the expense of filling gaps in their own</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">knowledge, and it gave their peers a leg up at test time. Salespeople are no different. In a study I led</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of </span><span class="cls_028">salespeople in North Carolina</span><span class="cls_004">, compared with takers and matchers, givers brought in two and a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">half times less annual sales revenue. They were so concerned about what was best for their customers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that they weren’t willing to sell aggressively.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Across occupations, it appears that givers are just too caring, too trusting, and too willing to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sacrifice their own interests for the benefit of others. There’s even evidence that compared with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers, on average, </span><span class="cls_028">givers earn 14 percent less money</span><span class="cls_004">, have </span><span class="cls_028">twice the risk of becoming victims of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">crimes</span><span class="cls_004">, and are </span><span class="cls_028">judged as 22 percent less powerful and dominant</span><span class="cls_004">.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">So if givers are most likely to land at the bottom of the success ladder, who’s at the top—takers or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:759.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">matchers?</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:3.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Neither. When I took another look at the data, I discovered a surprising pattern:</span><span class="cls_005"> It’s the givers</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As we’ve seen, the engineers with the lowest productivity are mostly givers. But when we look at</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">engineers with the best objective scores for quantity and quality of results are those who consistently</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">give more to their colleagues than they get. The worst performers and the best performers are givers;</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers and matchers are more likely to land in the middle.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This pattern holds up across the board. The Belgian medical students with the lowest grades have</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">medical school, being a giver accounts for 11 percent higher grades. Even in sales, I found that the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ladder. Across occupations, if you examine the link between reciprocity styles and success, the givers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">are more likely to become champs—not only chumps.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">After Danny Shader signed with the other investor, he had a gnawing feeling. “We just closed a big</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">round. We should be celebrating. Why am I not happier? I was excited about my investor, who’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">exceptionally bright and talented, but I was missing the opportunity to work with Hornik.” Shader</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wanted to find a way to engage Hornik, but there was a catch. To involve him, Shader and his lead</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">investor would have to sell more of the company, diluting their ownership.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Shader decided it was worth the cost to him personally. Before the financing closed, he invited</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hornik to invest in his company. Hornik accepted the offer and made an investment, earning some</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ownership of the company. He began coming to board meetings, and Shader was impressed with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hornik’s ability to push him to consider new directions. “I got to see the other side of him,” Shader</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:598.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chumps. The answer is less about raw talent or aptitude, and more about the strategies givers use and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">be the “Clinton of Illinois,” and he set his sights on winning a seat in the Senate. Sampson was an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">unlikely candidate for political office, having spent his early years working on a farm. But Sampson</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had great ambition; he made his first run for a seat in the state legislature when he was just twenty-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">three years old. There were thirteen candidates, and only the top four won seats. Sampson made a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lackluster showing, finishing eighth.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">After losing that race, Sampson turned his eye to business, taking out a loan to start a small shop</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with a friend. The business failed, and Sampson was unable to repay the loan, so his possessions</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were seized by local authorities. Shortly thereafter, his business partner died without assets, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sampson took on the debt. Sampson jokingly called his liability “the national debt”: he owed fifteen</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">times his annual income. It would take him years, but he eventually paid back every cent.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">After his business failed, Sampson made a second run for the state legislature. Although he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">only twenty-five years old, he finished second, landing a seat. For his first legislative session, he had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to borrow the money to buy his first suit. For the next eight years, Sampson served in the state</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">legislature, earning a law degree along the way. Eventually, at age forty-five, he was ready to pursue</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">influence on the national stage. He made a bid for the Senate.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sampson knew he was fighting an uphill battle. He had two primary opponents: James Shields</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Lyman Trumbull. Both had been state Supreme Court justices, coming from backgrounds far more</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">privileged than Sampson’s. Shields, the incumbent running for reelection, was the nephew of a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">congressman. Trumbull was the grandson of an eminent Yale-educated historian. By comparison,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sampson had little experience or political clout.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ground, climbing to 47 percent support. But the tide began to turn when a new candidate entered the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">race: the state’s current governor, Joel Matteson. Matteson was popular, and he had the potential to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">draw votes from both Sampson and Trumbull. When Shields withdrew from the race, Matteson</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">quickly took the lead. Matteson had 44 percent, Sampson was down to 38 percent, and Trumbull was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">at just 9 percent. But hours later, Trumbull won the election with 51 percent, narrowly edging out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Matteson’s 47 percent.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accused Matteson of trying to bribe influential voters. At minimum, Sampson had reliable information</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that some of his own key supporters had been approached by Matteson. If it appeared that Sampson</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would not stand a chance, Matteson argued, the voters should shift their loyalties and support him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sampson’s concerns about Matteson’s methods and motives proved prescient. A year later, when</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Matteson was finishing his term as governor, he redeemed old government checks that were outdated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">or had been previously redeemed, but were never canceled. Matteson took home several hundred</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thousand dollars and was indicted for fraud.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In addition to harboring suspicions about Matteson, Sampson believed in Trumbull, as they had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something in common when it came to the issues. For several years, Sampson had campaigned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">passionately for a major shift in social and economic policy. He believed it was vital to the future of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his state, and in this he and Trumbull were united. So instead of trying to convert Trumbull’s loyal</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">asked his supporters to vote for Trumbull. It was enough to propel Trumbull to victory, at Sampson’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guilty. According to a colleague, Sampson’s clients knew “they would win their case—if it was fair;</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sampson approached the judge. “If you can say anything for the man, do it—I can’t. If I attempt it, the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the case over to the associate, walking away from a sizable fee. These decisions earned him respect,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">greater good. When </span><span class="cls_028">experts in history, political science, and psychology rated the presidents</span><span class="cls_004">, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">identified Lincoln as a clear giver. “Even if it was inconvenient, Lincoln went out of his way to help</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">citizens.” It is noteworthy that Lincoln is seen as one of the least self-centered, egotistical, boastful</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">presidents ever. In independent ratings of presidential biographies, Lincoln scored in the top three—</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">along with Washington and Fillmore—in giving credit to others and acting in the best interests of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">others. In the words of a military general who worked with Lincoln, “he seemed to possess more of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the elements of greatness, combined with goodness, than any other.”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">If politics can be fertile ground for givers, it’s possible that givers can succeed in any job.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Whether giving is effective, though, depends on the particular kind of exchange in which it’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">employed. This is one important feature of giving to keep in mind as we move through the ideas in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this book: on any particular morning, giving may well be incompatible with success. In purely zero-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sum situations and win-lose interactions, giving rarely pays off. This is a lesson that Abraham Lincoln</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">learned each time he chose to give to others at his own expense. “If I have one vice,” Lincoln said,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“and I can call it nothing else—it is not to be able to say no!”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But most of life isn’t zero-sum, and on balance, people who choose giving as their primary</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reciprocity style end up reaping rewards. For Lincoln, like David Hornik, seemingly self-sacrificing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">decisions ultimately worked to his advantage. When we initially concluded that Lincoln and Hornik</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lost, we hadn’t stretched the time horizons out far enough. It takes time for givers to build goodwill</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and trust, but eventually, they establish reputations and relationships that enhance their success. In</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fact, you’ll see that in sales and medical school, the giver advantage grows over time. In the long run,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving can be every bit as powerful as it is dangerous. As Chip Conley, the renowned entrepreneur</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">who founded Joie de Vivre Hotels, explains, “Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">valuable in a marathon</span><span class="cls_004">.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In Lincoln’s era, the marathon took a long time to run. Without telephones, the Internet, and high-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">speed transportation, building relationships and reputations was a slow process. “In the old world,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">you could send a letter, and no one knew,” Conley says. Conley believes that in today’s connected</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">world, where relationships and reputations are more visible, givers can accelerate their pace. “You</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">news reports, audit companies, and provide consulting services. Teams depend on givers to share</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he was willing to contribute for the sake of other people and his country. Several years before</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Lincoln became president, one of his rivals, Edwin Stanton, had rejected him as a cocounsel in a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">trial, calling him a “gawky, long-armed ape.” Yet after working with Lincoln, Stanton described him</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as “the most perfect ruler of men the world has ever seen.” As we organize more people into teams,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">givers have more opportunities to demonstrate their value, as Lincoln did.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to spend their scarce time on people and ideas that have already shown promise, Hornik responds</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">whether I have some economic interest,” he says. According to Hornik, a successful venture capitalist</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">is “a service provider. Entrepreneurs are not here to serve venture capitalists. We are here to serve</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">grades in medical school. In the study of Belgian medical students, the givers earned significantly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lower grades in their first year of medical school. The givers were at a disadvantage—and the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But that was the only year of medical school in which the givers underperformed. By their second</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">year, the givers had made up the gap: they were now slightly outperforming their peers. By the sixth</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">year, the givers earned substantially higher grades than their peers. A giver style, measured </span><span class="cls_005">six years</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rates (and the effect of using nicotine patches on quitting smoking). By the seventh year of medical</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">school, when the givers became doctors, they had climbed still further ahead. The effect of giving on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">final medical school performance was stronger than the smoking effects above; it was even greater</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Why did the giver disadvantage reverse, becoming such a strong advantage?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Nothing about the givers changed, but their program did. As students progress through medical</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">further they advance, the more their success depends on teamwork and service. As the structure of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">class work shifts, the givers benefit from their natural tendencies to collaborate effectively with other</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">medical professionals and express concern to patients.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">single most influential factor,” Jones told me, “was whether a financial adviser had the client’s best</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">interests at heart, above the company’s and even his own. It was one of my three top priorities to get</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One financial adviser who exemplifies this giver style is Peter Audet, a broad-shouldered Aussie</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">client. The client wanted to make changes to a small superannuation fund valued at $70,000. A staff</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">member was assigned to the client, but looked him up and saw that he was a scrap metal worker.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Thinking like a matcher, the staff member declined to make the visit: it was a waste of his time. It</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">certainly wasn’t worth Peter’s time. He specialized in high net worth clients, whose funds were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">worth a thousand times more money, and his largest client had more than $100 million. If you</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">calculated the dollar value of Peter’s time, the scrap metal worker’s fund was not even worth the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">amount of time it would take to drive out to his house. “He was the tiniest client, and no one wanted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to see him; it was beneath everybody,” Peter reflects. “But you can’t just ignore someone because you</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">don’t think they’re important enough.”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">plan changes. When he pulled up to the house, his jaw dropped. The front door was covered in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cobwebs and had not been opened in months. He drove around to the back, where a thirty-four-year-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">old man opened the door. The living room was full of bugs, and he could see straight through to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">roof: the entire ceiling had been ripped out. The client made a feeble gesture to some folding chairs,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Peter began working through the client’s plan changes. Feeling sympathy for the client, who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seemed like an earnest, hardworking blue-collar man, Peter made a generous offer. “While I’m here,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">why don’t you tell me a bit about yourself and I’ll see if there’s anything else I can help you with.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The client mentioned a love of cars, and walked him around back to a dingy shed. Peter braced</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">himself for another depressing display of poverty, envisioning a pile of rusted metal. When Peter</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bought the house to fix it up; it was on eleven acres, and it cost $1.4 million. Peter spent the next year</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reengineering the client’s business, improving his tax position, and helping him renovate the house.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“All I did was start out by doing a kindness,” Peter notes. “When I got to work the next day, I had to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">laugh at my colleague who wasn’t prepared to give a bit by driving out to visit the client.” Peter went</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on to develop a strong relationship with the client, whose fees multiplied by a factor of a hundred the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and matchers routinely miss, but it has also cost him dearly. As you’ll see in chapter 7, he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">exploited by two takers who nearly put him out of business. Yet Peter managed to climb from the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Australia. The key, he believes, was learning to harness the benefits of giving while minimizing the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">costs. As a managing director at Genesys Wealth Advisers, he managed to rescue his firm from the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">brink of bankruptcy and turn it into an industry leader, and he chalks his success up to being a giver.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">choice,” Peter says. “When I’m head-to-head with another adviser to try and win business, people tell</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wanted to achieve in life, Hornik said that “above all, I want to demonstrate that success doesn’t have</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to come at someone else’s expense.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In an attempt to prove it, Hornik has broken two of the most sacred rules in the venture business.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In 2004, he became the first venture capitalist to start a blog. Venture capital was a black box, so</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">think. Hornik’s partners, and his firm’s general counsel, discouraged him from doing it. Why would he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sharing any in return. “The idea of a venture capitalist talking about what he was doing was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">technology conferences weren’t measuring up. “I discovered that I stopped going in to hear the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on. The real value of these events was the conversations and relationships that were created between</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people. What if a conference was about conversations and relationships, not content?”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In 2007, Hornik planned his first annual conference. It was called The Lobby, and the goal was to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bring entrepreneurs together to share ideas about new media. Hornik was putting about $400,000 on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the line, and people tried to talk him out of it. “You could destroy your firm’s reputation,” they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">warned, hinting that if the conference failed, Hornik’s own career might be ruined. But he pressed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forward, and when it was time to send out invitations, Hornik did the unthinkable. He invited venture</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">capitalists at rival firms to attend the conference.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Several colleagues thought he was out of his mind. “Why in the world would you let other venture</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">capitalists come to the conference?” they asked. If Hornik met an entrepreneur with a hot new idea at</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advantage and help his competitors find opportunities? Once again, Hornik ignored the naysayers. “I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">want to create an experience to benefit everyone, not just me.” One of the rival venture capitalists</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">matchers often see networking as an appealing way to connect with new people and ideas. We meet</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">many people throughout our professional and personal lives, and since we all have different</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">knowledge and resources, it makes sense to turn to these people to exchange help, advice, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">introductions. This raises a fundamental question: Can people build up networks that have breadth</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">disguised as givers or matchers. For the better part of two decades, this worked for Ken Lay, whose</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">favors and charitable contributions enabled people to see him in a positive light, opening the door to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But it can be difficult for takers to keep up the façade in all of their interactions. Ken Lay was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">charming when mingling with powerful people in Washington, but many of his peers and subordinates</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">saw through him. Looking back, one former Enron employee said, “If you wanted to get Lay to attend</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a meeting, you needed to invite someone important.” There’s a Dutch phrase that captures this duality</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">subordinates, they’re surprisingly submissive and deferential toward superiors. When takers deal</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with powerful people, they become convincing fakers. Takers want to be admired by influential</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">superiors, so they go out of their way to charm and flatter. As a result, powerful people tend to form</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to manipulate and exploit others.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When kissing up, takers are often good fakers. In 1998, when Wall Street analysts visited Enron,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were busy buying and selling energy and gas. This is another sign that Lay was a taker: he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">obsessed with making a good impression upward, but worried less about how he was seen by those</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Spencer and his friends cofounded Excite, an early Web portal and search engine that quickly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">became one of the most popular sites on the Internet. In 1998, Excite was purchased for $6.7 billion,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Spencer was flying high as its largest shareholder and chief technology officer. In 1999, shortly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">after selling Excite, Spencer received an e-mail out of the blue from Adam Rifkin, who was asking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for advice on a start-up. They had never met, but Spencer volunteered to sit down with Rifkin</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">anyway. After they met, Spencer connected Rifkin with a venture capitalist who ended up funding his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">start-up. How did Rifkin get access to Spencer? And why did Spencer go out of his way to help</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored with an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his computer prowess into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech server. “It was an authentic expression of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">being a fan of music. I loved the music.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as the band skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The band was called Green Day.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">1994, millions of people had visited Rifkin’s site. One of the visitors, a serious punk rock fan, felt</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that Green Day was really pop music. He had e-mailed Rifkin to educate him about “real” punk rock.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The fan was none other than Graham Spencer. Spencer suggested that when people searched for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:504.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">punk rock on the Internet, they should find more than Green Day. When Rifkin read the e-mail, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">imagined Spencer as a stereotypical punk rock fan with a green Mohawk. Rifkin had no idea that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Spencer would ever be able to help him—it would only come out much later that Spencer had just</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:558.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">started Excite. A taker or matcher might have ignored the e-mail from Spencer. But as a giver,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:576.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rifkin’s natural inclination was to help Spencer spread the word about punk rock and help struggling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:594.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bands build up a fan base. So Rifkin set up a separate page on the Green Day fan site with links to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:612.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">punk rock bands that Spencer suggested.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">acquaintances creates a psychological barrier. But givers like Adam Rifkin have discovered a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">loophole. It’s possible to get the best of both worlds: the trust of strong ties coupled with the novel</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">off, and Rifkin went back to graduate school. They lost touch for five years. When Rifkin was moving</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to Silicon Valley, he dug up the old e-mail chain and drafted a note to Spencer. “You may not</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rifkin wasn’t being a matcher. When he originally helped Spencer, he did it with no strings</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with a genuine request. Spencer was glad to help, and they met up for coffee. “I still pictured him as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this huge guy with a Mohawk,” Rifkin says. “When I met him in person, he hardly said any words at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">all. He was even more introverted than I am.” By the second meeting, Spencer was introducing Rifkin</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to a venture capitalist. “A completely random set of events that happened in 1994 led to reengaging</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">psychologist Brian Little, pronoia is “the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well-</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Because he maintains such a large network, Adam Rifkin has a growing number of </span><span class="cls_028">dormant ties</span><span class="cls_004">—</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:72.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people he used to see often or know well, but with whom he has since fallen out of contact.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:90.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">According to management professors Daniel Levin, Jorge Walter, and Keith Murnighan, “adults</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:108.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accumulate thousands of relationships over their lifetimes, but, prior to the Internet, they actively</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">maintained no more than 100 or 200 at any given time.” For the past few years, these professors have</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">been asking executives to do something that they dread: reactivate their dormant ties. When one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">executive learned of the assignment, “I groaned. If there are dormant contacts, they are dormant for a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reason, right? Why would I want to contact them?”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But the evidence tells a different story. In one study, Levin and colleagues asked more than two</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hundred executives to reactivate ties that had been dormant for a minimum of three years. Each</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">executive reached out to two former colleagues and sought advice on an ongoing work project. After</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">receiving the advice, they rated its value: to what extent did it help them solve problems and gain</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">useful referrals? They also rated the advice that they received from two current contacts on the same</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">project. Surprisingly, the executives rated the advice from the dormant ties as contributing more value</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">than the advice from the current ties. Why?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The dormant ties provided more novel information than the current contacts. Over the past few</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">years, while they were out of touch, they had been exposed to new ideas and perspectives. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">current contacts were more likely to share the knowledge base and viewpoint that the executives</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">already possessed. One executive commented that “before contacting them I thought that they would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">not have too much to provide beyond what I had already thought, but I was proved wrong. I was very</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">surprised by the fresh ideas.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Dormant ties offer the access to novel information that weak ties afford, but without the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">discomfort. As Levin and colleagues explain, “reconnecting a dormant relationship is not like starting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a relationship from scratch. When people reconnect, they still have </span><span class="cls_005">feelings of trust</span><span class="cls_004">.” An executive</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">divulged that “I feel comfortable . . . I didn’t need to guess what his intentions were . . . there was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:504.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mutual trust that we built years ago that made our conversation today smoother.” Reactivating a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dormant tie actually required a shorter conversation, since there was already some common ground.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The executives didn’t need to invest in building a relationship from the start with their dormant ties,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:558.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as they would with weak ties.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:576.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Levin and colleagues asked another group of more than one hundred executives to identify ten</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:594.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dormant ties and rank them in order of the likely value they would provide. The executives then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:612.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reactivated all ten dormant ties and rated the value of the conversations. All ten dormant ties</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:630.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">provided high value, and there were no differences by rank: the executives got just as much value</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from their tenth choice as from their first choice. When we need new information, we may run out of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">weak ties quickly, but we have a large pool of dormant ties that prove to be helpful. And the older we</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:684.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">get, the more dormant ties we have, and the more valuable they become. Levin and colleagues found</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that people in their forties and fifties received more value from reactivating dormant ties than people</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in their thirties, who in turn benefited more than people in their twenties. The executive who groaned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:738.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about reconnecting admitted that it “has been eye-opening for me . . . it has shown me how much</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers and matchers in unlocking this value. For takers, reactivating dormant ties is a challenge. If the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">information. If the dormant ties are matchers, they may be motivated to punish takers, as we saw in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ultimatum game. If the dormant ties are smart givers, as you’ll see later in this book, they won’t be so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">willing to help takers. And of course, if a taker’s self-serving actions were what caused a tie to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Matchers have a much easier time reconnecting, but they’re often uncomfortable reaching out for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">help because of their fidelity to the norm of reciprocity. When they ask for a favor, they feel that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they’ll owe one back. If they’re already indebted to the dormant tie and haven’t yet evened the score,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it’s doubly difficult to ask. And for many matchers, dormant ties haven’t built up a deep reservoir of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">trust, since they’ve been more like transactional exchanges than meaningful relationships.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">According to networking experts, reconnecting is a totally different experience for givers,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">especially in a wired world. Givers have a track record of generously sharing their knowledge,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">teaching us their skills, and helping us find jobs without worrying about what’s in it for them, so</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">networking with new people than he did earlier in his career, focusing instead on a growing number</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of dormant ties. “Now my time is spent going back to people who I haven’t talked to in a while.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When he reactivates one of his many dormant ties, the contact is usually thrilled to hear from him. His</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">generosity and kindness have earned their trust. They’re grateful for his help, and they know it didn’t</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">introduction. In 2006, Rifkin was looking for a dynamite speaker for a 106 Miles meeting. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reconnected with Evan Williams, and although Williams had become famous and was extremely busy</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with the launch of Twitter, he agreed. “Five years later, when we asked him to speak to the group, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">never forgot,” Rifkin says.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The type of goodwill that givers like Rifkin build is the subject of fascinating research.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Traditionally, social network researchers map information exchange: the flows of knowledge from</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">person to person. But when Wayne Baker collaborated with University of Virginia professor Rob</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cross and IBM’s Andrew Parker, he realized that it was also possible to track the flows of </span><span class="cls_028">energy</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">through networks</span><span class="cls_004">. In a range of organizations, employees rated their interactions with one another on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a scale from strongly de-energizing to strongly energizing. The researchers created an energy network</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">map, which looked like a model of a galaxy.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The takers were black holes. They sucked the energy from those around them. The givers were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">suns: they injected light around the organization. Givers created opportunities for their colleagues to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">contribute, rather than imposing their ideas and hogging credit for achievements. When they disagreed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with suggestions, givers showed respect for the people who spoke up, rather than belittling them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">If you mapped energy in Adam Rifkin’s network, you’d find that he looks like the sun in many</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">different solar systems. Several years ago at a holiday party, Rifkin met a struggling entrepreneur</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">named Raymond Rouf. They started chatting, and Rifkin gave him some feedback. Six months later,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rouf was working on a new start-up and reached out to Rifkin for advice. Rifkin replied the same day</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and set up a breakfast for the next morning, where he spent two hours giving more feedback to Rouf.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A few months later, they crossed paths again. Rouf had gone two years without an income, and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:759.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">plumbing in his house wasn’t working, so he bought a gym membership just to shower there. He ran</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">funding his company and becoming a board member. “The two of them would have meetings about</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rifkin has even managed to light up projects for a Hollywood writer/director. As you’ll see in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chapter 8, they met because Rifkin shared his contact information openly on the Internet. In a casual</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conversation, the Hollywood director mentioned that he had just finished production on a Showtime</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">much credence in his skill as a Hollywood publicist,” says the director. “Boy was I wrong!” Within</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">twenty-four hours, Rifkin set up meetings and private screenings of the show with top-ranking</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:294.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of giving, he went out of his way to introduce us to countless media</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">opportunities. When the dust had settled, he was singlehandedly responsible for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In 2012, a LinkedIn recruiter named Stephanie was asked to list the three people who had the most</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:72.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">influence on her career. Adam Rifkin was shocked to learn that he appeared on her list, because they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:90.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had met only once, months earlier. Stephanie was searching for a job and met Rifkin through a friend</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:108.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of a friend. He gave her advice, primarily by text message, and helped her find job leads. She e-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mailed him to express her gratitude and offered to reciprocate: “I know we only met in person once</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and we talk only occasionally, but you have helped me more than you know . . . I really would like to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">do something to help give back to you.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But Stephanie wasn’t just looking to help Adam Rifkin. Instead, she volunteered to attend a 106</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Miles meeting of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs so she could help Rifkin help them. At the meeting,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Stephanie would give entrepreneurs feedback on their ideas, offer to test their product prototypes, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">facilitate connections with potential collaborators and investors. The same thing has happened with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">many other people whom Rifkin helps. Raymond Rouf often drops by 106 Miles meetings to assist</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">other entrepreneurs. So does an engineer named Bob, who met Rifkin in a bar in 2009. They struck up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a conversation, and Rifkin learned that Bob was out of work, so he made some introductions that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">landed Bob a position. The company went out of business, and Rifkin made more connections that</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This is a new spin on reciprocity. In traditional old-school reciprocity, people operated like</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">gave to the people from whom we wanted something in return. But today, givers like Adam Rifkin are</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">able to spark a more powerful form of reciprocity. Instead of trading value, Rifkin aims to add value.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His giving is governed by a simple rule: the five-minute favor. “You should be willing to do</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something that will take you five minutes or less </span><span class="cls_005">for anybody</span><span class="cls_004">.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rifkin doesn’t think about what any of the people he helps will contribute back to him. Whereas</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:684.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">helping someone else. This increases the odds that the people in his vast network will seek to add</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">members were more likely to contribute in future rounds, even when interacting with people who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">weren’t present for the original act. “This influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">three degrees of separation (from person to person to person to person),” Fowler and Christakis find,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">such that “each additional contribution a subject makes . . . in the first period is tripled over the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When giving starts to occur, it becomes the norm, and people carry it forward in interactions with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">other people. To illustrate, imagine that you’re assigned to a group of four. The other three people are</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">strangers, and you’ll each make anonymous decisions, with no opportunity to communicate, during six</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rounds. In each round, each of you will receive $3 and decide whether to take it for yourselves or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">give it to the group. If you take it, you get the full $3. If you give it to the group, every group member</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">gets $2, including you. At the end of each round, you’ll find out what everyone decided. The group is</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">better off if everyone gives—each member would end up receiving $8 per round, for a maximum total</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">over six rounds of $48. But if you give and no one else does, you only get $12. This creates an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">incentive to take, which will guarantee you $18.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Since you can’t communicate with one another, giving is a risky strategy. But in the actual study,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">15 percent of the participants were </span><span class="cls_028">consistent givers</span><span class="cls_004">: they contributed to the group in all six rounds,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Surprisingly, the consistent givers still ended up doing well: they walked away with an average of 26</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">give more and get more?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When the groups included one consistent giver, the other members contributed more. The presence</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of a single giver was enough to establish a norm of giving. By giving, participants were able to make</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their group members better off and managed to get more in the process. Even though they earned 50</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">percent less from each contribution, because they inspired others to give, they made a larger total sum</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">available to all participants. The givers raised the bar and expanded the pie for the whole group.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In this experiment, the consistent givers were doing the equivalent of a five-minute favor when</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they contributed their money every round. They were making small sacrifices to benefit each member</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of the group, and it inspired the group members to do the same. Through the five-minute favor, Rifkin</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The takers had the lowest status. They burned bridges by constantly asking for favors but rarely</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Wright reportedly persuaded one of his fellow draftsmen to sign off on several of the houses. At one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:504.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">point, Wright promised his son John a salary for working as an assistant on several projects. When</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">picnic spots, where they could see a waterfall. Wright had a radically different idea in mind: he drew</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the house on a rock on top of the waterfall, which would be out of sight from the house. He convinced</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Oak Park, Illinois, where he benefited from the assistance of craftspeople and sculptors. In 1911,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he designed Taliesin, an estate in a remote Wisconsin valley. Believing he could excel alone, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">moved out there. But as time passed, Wright spun his wheels during “long years of enforced</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">idleness,” Gill wrote. At Taliesin, Wright lacked access to talented apprentices. “The isolation he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chose by creating Taliesin,” de St. Aubin observes, “left him without the elements that had become</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">essential to his life: architectural commissions and skillful workers to help him complete his building</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">convinced him to start a fellowship for apprentices to help him with his work. When apprentices</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">joined him in 1932, his productivity soared, and he was soon working on the Fallingwater house,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">depended on apprentices. He refused to pay apprentices, requiring them to do cooking, cleaning, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fieldwork. Wright “was a great architect,” explained his former apprentice </span><span class="cls_028">Edgar Tafel</span><span class="cls_004">, who worked</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Meyer would generate plenty of ideas for episodes, but he rarely wrote the first draft. Instead, feeling</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">months helping to rewrite and revise each episode. This is a defining feature of how givers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">collaborate: they take on the tasks that are in the group’s best interest, not necessarily their own</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">provided wilderness education to thousands of people, including crews of NASA astronauts.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Expedition behavior involves putting the group’s goals and mission first, and showing the same</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">than anything else.” John Kanengieter, who directs leadership at NOLS, adds that expedition behavior</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">is “not a zero-sum game: when you give it away, you gain more in response.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Part of Meyer’s success came from expanding the pie: the more he contributed to the success of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">also changed the way his colleagues saw him. When givers put a group’s interests ahead of their own,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they signal that their primary goal is to benefit the group. As a result, givers earn the respect of their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">collaborators. If Meyer had competed to draft his strongest sketches for Madonna, his fellow writers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">might have viewed him as a threat to their own status and careers. By doing his best work for less</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coveted guests, Meyer was doing his colleagues a favor. Takers no longer felt that they needed to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">compete with him, matchers felt that they owed him, and givers saw him as one of them. “When you</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">by givers, their colleagues listened and rewarded them for speaking up, knowing they were motivated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">by a genuine desire to contribute. “When I think about George in a writers’ room, nice is not what I</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advancement, the writers didn’t want to let him go. They quickly joined forces to recruit him back,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">desire to see and present ourselves positively. In line with this idea, Jonas Salk certainly didn’t avoid</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the spotlight. “One of his great gifts,” Oshinsky writes, “was a knack for putting himself forward in a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Meyer first started his career as a comedy writer, he didn’t use his perspective-taking skills in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">service of helping his colleagues. He saw his fellow writers as rivals:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:456.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When you start out, you see other people as obstacles to your success. But that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:474.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">means your world will be full of obstacles, which is bad. In the early years,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:492.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">when some of my colleagues and friends—even close friends—would have a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:528.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their success somehow was a reproach to me. When you start your career,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:546.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">naturally you’re mainly interested in advancing yourself and promoting yourself.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:586.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But as Meyer worked on television shows, he began to run into the same people over and over. It</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:604.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was a small world, and a connected one. “I realized it’s a very small pond. There are only a few</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:622.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hundred people at any one time writing television comedy for a living,” Meyer says. “It’s a good idea</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">not to alienate these guys, and most of the jobs you get are more or less through word of mouth, or a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:658.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">recommendation. It’s really important to have a good reputation. I quickly learned to see other</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:676.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">comedy writers as allies.” Meyer began to root for other people to succeed. “It’s not a zero-sum</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:694.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">game. So if you hear that somebody got a pilot picked up, or one of their shows went to series, in a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:712.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">way that’s really good, because comedy is doing better.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:730.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This wasn’t the path that Frank Lloyd Wright followed. He was undoubtedly a genius, but he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:748.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wasn’t a genius maker. When Wright succeeded, it didn’t multiply the success of other architects; it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:766.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">usually came at their expense. As Wright’s son John reflected, “You do a good job building your</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one and helped him up.” In one case, Wright promised his apprentices a drafting room so they could</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">promise. At one point, a client admitted that he preferred to hire Wright’s apprentices over Wright</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">himself, as the apprentices matched his talent but exceeded his conscientiousness when it came to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">completing work on schedule and within budget. Wright was enraged, and he forbade his architects</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from accepting independent commissions, requiring them to put his name at the top of all their work.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">later, Meyer is still working to lift his colleagues up. Despite winning five Emmy Awards, Tim Long</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Meyer a draft of a submission. Meyer responded swiftly with incisive feedback. “He just went</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">through it line by line, and he was incredibly generous. His notes helped me fix things that were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bugging me at the bottom of my soul, but I couldn’t articulate them.” Then, Meyer took his giving one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">step further: he reached out to an editor at </span><span class="cls_005">The New Yorker </span><span class="cls_004">to help Long get his foot in the door. By</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wrote jokes for free, and their careers soared along with Meyer’s. At least seven of those</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:641.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“He is the master of what he does.” When Obama was elected president, an aide remarked that Love</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">constraints. She was juggling a full-time job with taking care of three children at home—two of whom</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were toddlers, both of whom came down with chicken pox within two weeks of the exam. The lowest</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">days, felt like she understood less than when she started. When Beth sat down to take the CPA exam,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and evaluated more than thirty-five thousand students. Because of the time that he invests in his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">students, he has developed what may be his single most impressive skill: a remarkable eye for talent.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In 2004, Reggie Love enrolled in C. J. Skender’s accounting class at Duke. It was a summer</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Skender went out of his way to engage Love in class, and his intuition was right that it would pay</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Dov Eden began his research at the IDF, he wondered whether these types of self-fulfilling</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ahead of his own success. One of Inman’s star recruits was Tommie Smith, an exceptional athlete who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">came to San Jose State to run track and play football and basketball. On the freshman basketball team,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was going to quit basketball to focus on track. “I thought he was going to blow up at me,” Smith</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">writes, “but he didn’t. Coach Inman said, ‘Okay, Tom, I understand,’ he shook my hand and told me to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">discounting the negative feedback. The givers, on the other hand, accepted the criticism and followed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the suggestion. Even when they received negative feedback indicating that they were below average,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Takers tend to “discount social information and performance feedback that does not support their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">favorable view of themselves,” write Meglino and Korsgaard, whereas givers “may be more apt to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accept and act on social information without carefully evaluating the personal consequences.” Givers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">focus more on the interpersonal and organizational consequences of their decisions, accepting a blow</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This receptivity to negative feedback helped Stu Inman recognize when he had made a bad</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">investment. Inman was admired around the league for his openness to criticism. Many coaches “took</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Inman,” who was “patient and generous,” and “one of the most gracious men ever associated with the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">NBA.” When LaRue Martin underperformed, the Blazers coach at the time, Jack McCloskey, voiced</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his concerns to Inman. “He worked hard and was a very nice young man, but he wasn’t skilled. It was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that simple. I tried to develop his skills around the basket, and he wasn’t an outside player. He didn’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">have the skills to be the number-one pick.” A taker might have rejected the negative feedback, but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Inman listened to it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">After Martin’s second season, in 1974, the Blazers landed the first pick in the draft again. Having</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seeing potential,” noted Steve Duin. “Stu, in the subculture of basketball gurus, was near the apex. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was considered a genius,” said Mavericks president Norm Sonju. In a chronicle of the 1984 draft,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Filip Bondy writes that Inman was viewed by many as “the best personnel man in the league. He was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rumors about which players might interest him.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the 1970s, most basketball teams were focusing heavily on observable physical talents such as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">speed, strength, coordination, agility, and vertical leap. Inman thought it was also important to pay</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">attention to the inner attributes of players, so he decided to begin evaluating their psychological</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">makeup. Before a draft, along with reviewing a player’s statistics and watching him play, Inman</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wanted to understand him as a person. He would watch players closely during the pregame warm-up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to see how hard they worked, and he would interview their coaches, family members, friends, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">teachers about issues of motivation, mind-set, and integrity. According to the</span><span class="cls_005"> Oregonian, </span><span class="cls_004">“Inman</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In 1970, Inman joined the Blazers, then a brand-new NBA team, as chief talent scout. That</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">public relations stunt to generate local excitement about basketball, but Inman was also looking for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">players who had gone overlooked by other teams. None of the guys from the open tryout made the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">team, but Inman’s fascination with unlikely candidates would bear fruit several years later. In 1975,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with the twenty-fifth pick in the second round of the draft, Inman selected a little-known Jewish</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">basketball at Seattle, averaging ten points a game, and then transferred to Long Beach State, where he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">averaged just six and a half points in his junior year. “The story of Bob Gross’s collegiate and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:558.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">professional basketball life was that nobody noticed him,” wrote Frank Coffey in a book about the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:576.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Blazers, “until they really started looking hard.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:594.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Inman happened to see a game between Long Beach and Michigan State, and his interest was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:612.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">piqued when Gross hustled to block a shot on what should have been an easy Spartan layup on a fast</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:630.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">break. Inman took a closer look and saw more evidence of Gross’s work ethic: he more than doubled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his scoring average from his junior to senior year, when he put in more than sixteen points a game.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Inman “discovered a jewel, a consistent, hardworking, extraordinarily effective basketball player,”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When the Blazers made the Finals in his third NBA season, Gross delivered, pouring in an average of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seventeen points per game. In the pivotal games five and six, he guarded Julius Erving and led the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:738.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Blazers by scoring twenty-five and twenty-four points. According to Bill Walton, “Bob Gross was the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">or use the flashiest of moves. His philosophy was that “It’s not what a player is, but what he can</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">become . . . that will allow him to grow.” When Inman saw a guy practice with grit and play like a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giver, he classified him as a diamond in the rough. In fact, there’s a close connection between grit and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving. In my own research, I’ve found that because of their dedication to others, </span><span class="cls_028">givers are willing to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">work harder and longer</span><span class="cls_004"> than takers and matchers. Even when practice is no longer enjoyable, givers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">continue exerting effort out of a sense of responsibility to their team.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This pattern can be seen in many other industries. Consider Russell Simmons, the cofounder of the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Simmons is often called the godfather of hip-hop, and he was giving away music for free as early as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">1978, long before most labels started doing that. When I asked him about his success, he attributed it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to finding and promoting givers. “Good givers are great getters; they make everybody better,”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Simmons explains. One of his favorite givers is Kevin Liles, who started working for free as an intern</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and rose all the way up to become president of Def Jam. As an intern, Liles was the first to arrive at</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">out of his way to promote other regions too. “Everybody started to look at Kevin as a leader, because</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they all looked to him for direction. He gave until people couldn’t live without him.” In selecting and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wasn’t regarded as a very strong shooter. Although he was the fifth shooting guard chosen, Drexler is</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">now widely regarded as the steal of the 1983 draft. He outscored all other players in the draft,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As a giver, Inman was open to outside advice. While at San Jose State, Inman met Bruce Ogilvie,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a pioneer in sports psychology who “came onto the sports scene when psychologists were referred to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as ‘shrinks’ and any player going to visit one was seen as a problem.” Most general managers and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coaches avoided psychologists like Ogilvie, approaching the so-called science skeptically. Some</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">viewed psychological assessment as irrelevant; others worried that it would threaten their own</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">expertise and standing.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Whereas takers often strive to be the smartest people in the room, givers are more receptive to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">expertise from others, even if it challenges their own beliefs. Inman embraced Ogilvie and his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">methods with open arms, requiring players to undergo several hours of evaluation before the draft.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Inman worked with Ogilvie to assess players on their selflessness, desire to succeed, willingness to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">persevere, receptivity to being coached, and dedication to the sport. Through these assessments,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Inman could develop a deep understanding of a player’s tendencies toward grit and giving. “Other</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">NBA teams were taking psychological looks at draftable players, but none to the degree that we used</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it and trusted it,” Inman said. “You had to like the talent before you would consider it in your</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">evaluation. But it provided a clear barometer as to whether the guy would fulfill his potential.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Ogilvie assessed Drexler, Inman was impressed with his psychological profile. Inman</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">interviewed the coaches who had seen Drexler play at Houston, and there was a consistent theme:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Drexler played like a giver. “Clyde was the glue on that team. I was taken by the almost unanimous</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reaction from other coaches in that league,” Inman explained. “They said he did what he had to do to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">win a game. His ego never interfered with his will to win.” According to Bucky Buckwalter, who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was then a scout, “There was some reluctance from teams . . . He was not a great shooter.” But Inman</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and his team decided that Drexler could “learn to shoot from the perimeter, or somehow make up for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it with his other talents.” Inman was right: Drexler “turned out to be a more skilled player . . . than I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would have expected,” Buckwalter said.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Even Inman’s bad bets on the basketball court have gone on to success elsewhere; the man knew a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giver when he saw one. LaRue Martin has worked at UPS for twenty-five years, most recently as the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">And remember Terry Murphy, Inman’s worst player at San Jose State? Inman gave Murphy a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Inman was spot-on about his work ethic: Murphy ended up making the U.S. national volleyball team.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But Murphy didn’t leave basketball behind altogether: in 1986, to raise money for the Special</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Wizards, he used the first pick in the 2001 draft to select center Kwame Brown. Brown was straight</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">out of high school, loaded with talent, but seemed to lack grit, and never came anywhere near his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">potential. Later, he would be called the second-biggest NBA draft bust of the decade and one of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one hundred worst picks in sports history. After Brown, the second and third picks in the drafts were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">also centers, and they fared far better. The second pick was Tyson Chandler, who went on to make the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">2012 U.S. Olympic team. The third pick was Pau Gasol, another young center less than a year and a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">half older than Brown. Gasol won the Rookie of the Year award, and in the coming decade, he would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">make four All-Star teams, win two NBA championships, and earn the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Award. Both Gasol and Chandler swamped Brown’s performance in scoring, rebounding, and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Brown’s disappointing results appeared to threaten Jordan’s ego. When Jordan came out of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">poor performance was hurting the team—and making Jordan’s draft choice look foolish. In his first</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">season, Brown put up paltry numbers, averaging less than five points and four rebounds per game. Yet</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in his second season, Brown’s minutes on the court doubled.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Jordan was fired from the Wizards after that season, but he wasn’t ready to give up on Brown.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Nearly a decade later, in 2010, Brown signed a contract with the Charlotte Bobcats, a team owned by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">none other than Michael Jordan. “Michael was very much a part of this,” Brown’s agent said. “He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wanted this to happen.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">By that point, Brown had played ten seasons for four different teams, averaging under seven</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">points and six rebounds in more than five hundred games. In his previous season, he was spending</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">just thirteen minutes on the court. When Brown joined Jordan’s Bobcats, his playing time was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">doubled to twenty-six minutes a game. The Bobcats gave Brown more minutes than he had played in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the prior two seasons combined, yet he continued to struggle, averaging under eight points and seven</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rebounds. Jordan “wanted to give Kwame another opportunity,” Brown’s agent said. “There’s been so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">much written about the fact that this was Michael’s first pick and so much criticism directed at both of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them when it didn’t work out.” A giver might admit the mistake and move on, but Jordan was still</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">trying to turn the bad investment around. “I love Michael, but he just has not done a good job,” says</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">friend and former Olympic teammate Charles Barkley. “I don’t think Michael has hired enough people</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around him who will disagree.” Under Jordan’s direction, in 2012, the Bobcats finished with the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">worst winning percentage in NBA history.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">competition, as it was entitled to do. Acme did lose some customers, the lawyer admitted, but it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wasn’t because the employees did anything wrong. Acme was the middle man distributing Jayant’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">more cheaply, which is precisely the point of fair competition. The employees were being treated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">poorly at Acme: one described it as a “hellhole,” the worst job of her life. The defense attorney</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">nailed his key arguments, and he questioned the credibility of Dave’s main witnesses. Dave was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">impressed with the skill that the defense attorney demonstrated. “He was really good. He made better</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">arguments than we anticipated.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Dave knew the trial could go either way. On the one hand, he had painted a compelling portrait</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that Jayant and the two employees were guilty. On the other hand, this was a high-pressure, high-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">profile case. It was Dave’s first time taking the lead in a jury trial; he was by far the youngest lawyer</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">there. During one of his examinations, an old foe reared its head: Dave started stammering. This</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">happened a few more times, and it signaled that he lacked confidence.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Dave was particularly concerned about the effect on one particular juror. During the trial, this</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">juror made it clear that he was in favor of the defendants: he felt that Jayant and the employees had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">done nothing wrong. The juror responded enthusiastically to the defense attorney, nodding</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">appreciatively throughout his arguments and laughing loudly at his jokes. In contrast, when Dave</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">spoke, the juror avoided eye contact, smirked, and made dismissive gestures. Throughout the trial, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">juror came to court wearing blue jeans. But on the day of the closing arguments, the juror arrived</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wearing a suit and tie. When Dave watched the juror waltz in, his heart sank. The juror wanted to be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the foreman, and he was obviously vying to turn the jury against Dave’s case.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Dave finished his closing, and the jury went into deliberation. When they came out, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">antagonistic juror walked out first. He had been elected foreman, and he read the verdict.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The jury ruled in favor of Dave’s client, to the tune of $7 million. Dave’s victory set a record for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the largest trade-secret verdict in Pennsylvania. There’s no doubt that Dave presented a brilliant case,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">speaking with conviction as a true expert in his field. But there was another factor that gave him the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Stuttering is a speech disorder that affects about 1 percent of the population. Growing up, Dave</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Walton was teased and ridiculed for stuttering. When he graduated from college, he applied for a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sales job, but was turned down. “The interviewer told him he would never make it in sales because</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of his stutter,” his wife Mary says. When Dave decided to apply to law school, many of his friends</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and family members raised their eyebrows, hoping he wouldn’t have to do any public speaking. In</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">law school, it seemed that their fears were prescient. Dave recalls that during his first mock court</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">argument, the judge started crying. “She felt bad for me.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Most people see stuttering as a disability, and we marvel at people like Jack Welch and James</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">truth is far more interesting and complex. Many people who stutter end up becoming quite successful,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and it’s not always because they have conquered their stuttering. In the trade secrets trial, when Dave</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the jury, helping to tip the balance in his favor. When the jurors commended him, Dave was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When we establish dominance, we gain influence because others see us as strong, powerful, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">authoritative. When we earn prestige, we become influential because others respect and admire us.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ended with the line, “Drive it. You’ll get it.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It wasn’t standard practice for an account person to come to the creative team with a solution,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">instead of a problem to solve. In fact, it was forbidden for an account guy to contribute to the creative</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">process. So Lane had a dilemma: how could he get the creative team to listen? If he were a taker, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">might have stormed into the creative director’s office to pitch the line, lobby powerfully for it, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">demand full credit. If he were a matcher, he might have offered a favor to the creative team and hoped</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for reciprocity, or called in a favor owed. But Lane leaned in the giver direction. He wasn’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">concerned about the credit; he just wanted to help the creative team and see a good line get</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">implemented. “In our business, creative people are gifted and deserve to get most of, if not all of, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">credit. Some account management people resent that,” Lane says. “I knew that my job was to help</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">creative people and provide space for them to come up with ideas. I didn’t really care if anyone knew</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it was my idea. It didn’t matter where the idea came from. If it worked, we would all share in the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Lane walked into the creative director’s office. Instead of using powerful communication—“I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">have a great line, you should use it”—he went with a softer approach. He presented a sample radio</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">script to show how it would work. Then he said to the creative director, “I know this is against the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The creative director got it. He looked up at Lane, smiled, and said, “That’s our campaign.” The</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:72.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lose her position was an effervescent </span><span class="cls_028">research scientist</span><span class="cls_004"> named Annie. The company offered Annie a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:90.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">transfer to the East Coast, but it would require her to give up on her education. While working full</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:108.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time, Annie was enrolled in a nighttime MBA program. She couldn’t afford to quit her job, and if she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">did, the company would no longer pay for her degree. Yet if she accepted the transfer, she wouldn’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">be able to continue studying. She was in a bind, with little time and few options.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Two weeks later, something extraordinary happened: she was offered a seat on the company’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">private jet, which was normally available only to top executives, with unlimited access until she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">finished her MBA. She accepted the transfer and spent the next nine months riding the corporate jet</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">back and forth, twice a week, until she finished her degree. The company also paid for her rental car</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">every week and commercial plane tickets when the corporate jet wasn’t running. How did she get the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">company to make such a big investment in her?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Annie landed all of these perks without ever negotiating. Instead, she used a form of powerless</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">communication that’s quite familiar to givers.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Entering negotiations, takers typically work to establish a dominant position. Had Annie been a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">taker, she might have compiled a list of all of her merits and attracted counteroffers from rival</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">companies to strengthen her position. Matchers are more inclined to see negotiating as an opportunity</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for quid pro quo. If Annie were a matcher, she would have gone to a senior leader who owed her a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">favor and asked for reciprocity. But Annie is a giver: she mentors dozens of colleagues, volunteers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for the United Way, and visits elementary school classes to interest students in science. When her</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">colleagues make a mistake, she’s regularly the one to take responsibility, shielding them from the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blame at the expense of her own performance. She once withdrew a job application when she learned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that a friend was applying for the same position.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As a giver, Annie wasn’t comfortable bargaining like a taker or a matcher, so she chose an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">entirely different strategy. She reached out to a human resources manager and asked for advice. “If</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:504.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">you were in my shoes, what would you do?”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:522.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The manager became Annie’s advocate. She reached out to the heads of Annie’s department and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">site, and started to lobby on Annie’s behalf. The department head, in turn, called Annie and asked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:558.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">what he could do to keep her. Annie mentioned that she wanted to finish her MBA, but couldn’t afford</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:576.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to fly back and forth. In response, the department head offered her a seat on the jet.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:594.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">New research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effective strategy for </span><span class="cls_028">exercising</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:630.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">negotiate the possible sale of commercial property. When the sellers focused on their goal of getting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the highest possible price, only 8 percent reached a successful agreement. When the sellers asked the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">buyers for advice on how to meet their goals, 42 percent reached a successful agreement. Asking for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:684.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advice encouraged greater cooperation and information sharing, turning a potentially contentious</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">negotiation into a win-win deal. Studies demonstrate that across the manufacturing, financial services,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">insurance, and pharmaceuticals industries, seeking advice is among the most </span><span class="cls_028">effective ways to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:738.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">influence</span><span class="cls_004"> peers, superiors, and subordinates. Advice seeking tends to be significantly more</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Takers assume that the best path to a board seat is ingratiation. They flatter a director with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">compliments, or track down his friends to praise him indirectly. Yet Stern and Westphal found that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">flattery only worked when it was coupled with advice seeking. Instead of just complimenting a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When praising a director’s skill, the advice-seeking executives asked how she mastered it. When</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">replicate his success. When executives asked a director for advice in this manner, that director was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Advice seeking is a form of powerless communication that combines expressing vulnerability,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">asking questions, and talking tentatively. When we ask others for advice, we’re posing a question that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conveys uncertainty and makes us vulnerable. Instead of confidently projecting that we have all the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">answers, we’re admitting that others might have superior knowledge. As a result, takers and matchers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tend to shy away from advice seeking. From a taker’s perspective, asking for advice means</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">acknowledging that you don’t have all the answers. Takers may fear that seeking advice might make</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them look weak, dependent, or incompetent. They’re wrong: research shows that people who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">regularly seek advice and help</span><span class="cls_004"> from knowledgeable colleagues are actually rated more favorably by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">supervisors than those who never seek advice and help.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Appearing vulnerable doesn’t bother givers, who worry far less about protecting their egos and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">projecting certainty. When givers ask for advice, it’s because they’re genuinely interested in learning</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from others. Matchers hold back on advice seeking for a different reason: they might owe something</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in return.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">According to Liljenquist, advice seeking has four benefits: learning, perspective taking,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">commitment, and flattery. When Annie asked for advice, she discovered something she didn’t know</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">before: the company’s jet had extra seats, and it traveled back and forth between her two key</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">locations. Had she lobbied more assertively instead of seeking advice, she might never have gained</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this information. In fact, Annie had several previous conversations in which no one mentioned the jet.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This brings us to the second benefit of advice seeking: encouraging others to take our</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">perspectives. In Annie’s previous conversations, where she didn’t ask for advice, the department</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">offer Annie more than just the corporate jet. Half a century ago, the psychologists Jon Jecker and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">David Landy paid people for succeeding on a geometry task. In the control group, the participants</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">kept the money, and visited the department secretary to fill out a final questionnaire. But when another</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">group of participants started to leave, the researcher asked them for help. “I was wondering if you</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Nearly all of the participants gave the money back. When questioned about how much they liked</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">who didn’t. Why?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When we give our time, energy, knowledge, or resources to help others, we strive to maintain a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">belief that they’re worthy and deserving of our help. Seeking advice is a subtle way to invite someone</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to make a commitment to us. Once the department head took the time to offer advice to Annie, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">became more invested in her. Helping Annie generate a solution reinforced his commitment to her:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">she must be worthy of his time. If she wasn’t important to him, why would he have bothered to help</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">her? As Benjamin Franklin wrote in his autobiography, “</span><span class="cls_028">He that has once done you a kindness</span><span class="cls_004"> will be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When we ask people for advice, we grant them prestige, showing that we respect and admire their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">insights and expertise. Since most people are matchers, they tend to respond favorably and feel</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">motivated to support us in return. When Annie approached the human resources manager for advice,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the manager stepped up and went to bat for her. According to biographer Walter Isaacson, Benjamin</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Franklin saw advice seeking as a form of flattery. Franklin “had a </span><span class="cls_028">fundamental rule for winning</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">friends</span><span class="cls_004">,” Isaacson writes: appeal to “their pride and vanity by constantly seeking their opinion and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advice, and they will admire you for your judgment and wisdom.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Regardless of their reciprocity styles, people love to be asked for advice. Giving advice makes</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers feel important, and it makes givers feel helpful. Matchers often enjoy giving advice for a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">different reason: it’s a low-cost way of racking up credits that they can cash in later. As a result, when</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">we ask people for advice, they tend to respond positively to us.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But here’s the catch: advice seeking only works if it’s genuine. In her research on advice seeking,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Liljenquist finds that success “depends on the target perceiving it as a sincere and authentic gesture.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When she directly encouraged people to seek advice as an influence strategy, it fell flat. Their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">counterparts recognized them as fakers: they could tell that the advice seekers were ingratiating based</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on ulterior motives. “People who are suspected of strategically managing impressions are more likely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to be seen as selfish, cold, manipulative, and untrustworthy,” Liljenquist writes. Advice seeking was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">only effective when people did it spontaneously. Since givers are more willing to seek advice than</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers and matchers, it’s likely that many of the spontaneous advice seekers in her studies were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">givers. They were actually interested in other people’s perspectives and recommendations, and they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were rated as better listeners.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Conrey hit rock bottom at Overbrook High School, she felt that she was giving too much.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">She was arriving at work early, staying up late, and working weekends, and she could hardly keep up.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In this situation, it seems that the natural way to recover and recharge would be to reduce her giving.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But that wasn’t what she did. Instead, Conrey gave </span><span class="cls_005">more</span><span class="cls_004">.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">While maintaining her overwhelming teaching workload, Conrey began volunteering her time as a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">TFA alumni mentor. As a content support specialist, every other week she helped ten different</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">teachers create tests and design new lesson plans. Then, in her limited spare time, she founded a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mentoring program. With two friends, she created a Philadelphia chapter of Minds Matter, a national</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">nonprofit organization that helps high-achieving, low-income students prepare for college. Conrey</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">spent her nights and weekends filing for nonprofit status, finding a pro-bono law firm and accountant,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and applying for national approval. Finally, after a year, she was able to start recruiting students and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mentors, and she created the plans for weekly sessions. From then on, Conrey added five hours a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">week mentoring high school students.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">All told, Conrey was spending more than ten extra hours per week giving. This meant even less</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">And yet, when she started giving more, Conrey’s burnout faded, and her energy returned. Suddenly, in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fact, she seemed to be a renewed bundle of energy at Overbrook, finding the strength to serve as the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A decade ago, Howard Heevner, a dynamic director of a university </span><span class="cls_028">call center</span><span class="cls_004">, invited me to help him</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:72.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">figure out how to maintain the motivation of his callers. The callers were charged with contacting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:90.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">university alumni and asking them to donate money. They were required to ask for donations three</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:108.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">times before hanging up, and still faced a rejection rate exceeding 90 percent. Even the most seasoned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and successful callers were burning out. As one experienced caller put it: “I found the calls I was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">making to be extremely difficult. Many of the prospects cut me off in my first couple of sentences and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">told me they were not interested in giving.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">I assumed that the takers were dropping like flies: they wouldn’t be as committed as the givers.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">So during training, I measured whether each caller was a giver, matcher, or taker. In their first month</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on the job, the takers were bringing in an average of more than thirty donations a week. Contrary to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">my expectation, the givers were much less productive: they were struggling to maintain their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">motivation, making fewer calls and bringing in under ten donations a week. I was mystified: why</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were the callers who wanted to make a difference actually making the least difference?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">I got my answer one day when I paid a visit to the call center, and noticed a sign one of the callers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had posted above his desk:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:232.16px;top:363.75px" class="cls_007"><span class="cls_007">DOING A GOOD JOB HERE</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:208.54px;top:386.25px" class="cls_020"><span class="cls_020">Is Like Wetting Your Pants in a Dark Suit</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:148.57px;top:408.75px" class="cls_007"><span class="cls_007">YOU GET A WARM FEELING BUT NO ONE ELSE NOTICES</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:460.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">According to my data, the caller who proudly displayed this sign was a strong giver. Why would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:478.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a giver feel unappreciated? In reflecting on this sign, I began to think that my initial assumption was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:496.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">correct after all: based on the motivational structure of the job, the givers should be outpacing the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:514.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers. The problem was that the givers were being deprived of the rewards they find most</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">energizing.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:550.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The takers were motivated by the fact that they were working at the highest-paying job on campus.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:568.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But the givers lacked the rewards that mattered most to them. Whereas takers tend to care most about</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:586.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">benefiting personally from their jobs, givers care deeply about doing jobs that benefit other people.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:604.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When the callers brought in donations, most of the money went directly to student scholarships, but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:622.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the callers were left in the dark: they had no idea who was receiving the money, and how it affected</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their lives.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:658.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At the next training session, I invited new callers to read letters from students whose scholarships</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:676.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had been funded by the callers’ work. One scholarship student named Will wrote:</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:114.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">After reading the letters, it took the givers just a week to catch up to the takers. The takers did</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:132.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">show some improvement, but the givers responded most powerfully, nearly tripling in weekly calls</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:150.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and donations. Now, they had a stronger emotional grasp of their impact: if they brought in more</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:168.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">money, they could help more scholarship students like Will. By spending just five minutes reading</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:186.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about how the job helped other people, the givers were motivated to achieve the same level of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">productivity as the takers.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:222.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But the givers still weren’t seeing the full impact of their jobs. Instead of reading letters, what if</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:240.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they actually met a scholarship recipient face-to-face? When callers interacted with one scholarship</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:258.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">recipient in person, they were even more energized. The average caller doubled in calls per hour and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">minutes on the phone per week. By working harder, the callers reached more alumni, resulting in 144</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:294.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">percent more alumni donating each week. Even more strikingly, revenue quintupled: callers averaged</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">$412 before meeting the scholarship recipient and more than $2,000 afterward. One caller soared</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from averages of five calls and $100 per shift to nineteen calls and $2,615 per shift. Several control</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:366.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">donations, or revenue. Overall, just five minutes interacting with one scholarship recipient motivated</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:402.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">givers, takers, and matchers were all motivated by meeting the scholarship recipient, the gains in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:420.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">effort and revenue were especially pronounced among the givers.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:438.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The turnaround highlights a remarkable principle of giver burnout: it has less to do with the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:456.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">amount of giving and more with the amount of feedback about the impact of that giving. Researchers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:474.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">have drawn the same conclusion in health care, where burnout is often described as </span><span class="cls_028">compassion</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:492.75px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">fatigue</span><span class="cls_004">, “the stress, strain, and weariness of caring for others.” Originally, experts believed that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:510.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">compassion fatigue was caused by expressing too much compassion. But new research has challenged</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:528.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this conclusion. As researchers Olga Klimecki and Tania Singer summarize, “More than all other</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:546.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">factors, including . . . the time spent caregiving, it is the perceived suffering that leads to depressive</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:564.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">symptoms in the caregiver.” Givers don’t burn out when they devote too much time and energy to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:582.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving. They burn out when they’re working with people in need but are unable to help effectively.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:600.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Teachers are vulnerable to giver burnout because of the unique temporal experience that defines</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">education. Even though teachers interact with their students on a daily basis, it can take many years</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for their impact to sink in. By then, students have moved on, and teachers are left wondering: did my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:654.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">work actually matter? With no clear affirmation of the benefits of their giving, the effort becomes</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:672.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">more exhausting and harder to sustain. These challenges are pervasive in a setting like Overbrook,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">where teachers must fight many distractions and disadvantages to stimulate the attention—let alone</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:708.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">attendance—of students. When Conrey Callahan was emotionally exhausted, it wasn’t because she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:726.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was giving too much. It was because she didn’t feel her giving was making a difference. “In teaching,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:744.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">do I have an impact? It’s kind of dicey,” Conrey told me. “I often feel like I’m not doing anything</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">but the net effect was to fill the impact vacuum that she experienced in her teaching job at Overbrook.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“With my mentoring program, there’s no doubt; I know that I have a more direct impact,” she says. By</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mentoring low-income students who were high achievers, she felt able to make more of a difference</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">than in her Overbrook classroom, where each student presented specific challenges. When she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mentored high-achieving students, the positive feedback came more rapidly and validated her effort.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">She watched one mentee, David, blossom from a shy, reserved loner into an outspoken young man</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with a close group of friends. As with the fund-raising callers meeting a scholarship student who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">benefited from their work, seeing the impact of her program had an energizing effect.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But that effect wasn’t limited to the mentoring program. Thanks to the energy boost, Conrey</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">developed renewed hope that she could have an impact in her job at Overbrook. Observing the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">progress of her high-achieving mentees instilled confidence that she could help the students struggling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in her own classroom. “I know what I’ve started is really making a difference with these kids. What</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">against stress</span><span class="cls_004">, enabling employees to avoid burnout and maintain their motivation and performance. In</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">demanding reported significantly greater burnout. But upon closer inspection, job stress was only</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">linked to higher burnout for teachers who felt they didn’t make a difference. A sense of lasting impact</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">protected against stress, preventing exhaustion.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the classroom, it sometimes takes years for a teacher’s lesson to hit home with students. By that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time, many teachers have lost contact with their students. But at least for a while, teachers have the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">opportunity to see their short-term impact as they interact face-to-face with their students. Many other</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">jobs provide no contact at all with the people who benefit from our work. In health care, for example,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">many medical professionals provide critical diagnoses without ever meeting the patients on the other</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tomography (CT) exams from patients. After three months passed, the radiologists had forgotten the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">original CT exams, and they evaluated them again. Some of the radiologists got better, showing 53</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">percent improvement in detecting abnormalities unrelated to the primary reason for the exams. But</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">other radiologists got worse: their accuracy dropped by 28 percent—on the exact same CT exams, in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">among givers, a firsthand connection to impact can tilt people of all reciprocity styles in the giver</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Conrey’s extra giving was energizing, and it has to do with where and to whom she gave. Nearly a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they enjoyed them, but to stop when they were tired. For long periods of time, the participants toiled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">away at tasks like drawing pictures and reading poems aloud, until they couldn’t handle it any longer.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">more and more about education. I had a natural passion for it.” Sean decided to lead and launch two</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">new programs around education. One program is called The Classroom Economy, and it has a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">national focus: Sean and his colleagues teach the basics of money management to kindergartners</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around the United States. The other program, Team Vanguard, is local: Sean has partnered with a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">charter school in Philadelphia to administer a four-year mentoring program, where employees</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">volunteer their time on evenings, weekends, and lunch breaks. Despite the substantial time</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">commitment, Sean found that both programs “have a tremendously positive impact on my energy. It’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the selling point I have with senior staff who worry about volunteer hours, which take time out of the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">drew her into teaching. In her volunteer work, giving is an enjoyable choice: she loves helping high-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">achieving underprivileged students and mentoring less experienced TFA teachers. This is another way</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving can be otherish: Conrey focused on benefiting students and teachers, but doing so in a way that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">connects to her core values and fuels her enthusiasm. The energy carried over to her classroom,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But at Overbrook, Conrey couldn’t avoid the obligation to give to her students in ways that she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">didn’t find naturally exciting or energizing. What did she do to stay energized despite the sense of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">help. Sarah recommended an activity that was a hit in her classroom: they got to design their own</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">monsters that were on the loose in Philadelphia. They drew a picture of a monster, wrote a story</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about it, and created a “wanted” ad so people would be on the lookout. It was exactly the inspiration</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that Conrey needed. “Our ten-minute chat helped me get excited about the lesson. I had fun with the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">kids, and it made me more invested in the curriculum I was teaching.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Although Conrey’s decision to ask another teacher for help may not sound unusual, research</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shows that it’s quite rare among selfless givers. Selfless givers “feel uncomfortable receiving</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:72.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time and energy that the health professionals gave to patients, and asked them to report how burned</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:108.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the health professionals gave, the more burned out they became in the following year. Those who gave</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">selflessly had the highest burnout rates: they contributed far more than they got, and it exhausted them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Those who acted like matchers and takers were far less burned out.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But strangely, in another study, the Dutch psychologists found evidence that some health care</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">professionals seemed immune to burnout. Even when they gave a great deal of time and energy, they</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">selfless givers, the greatest resilience may belong to otherish givers.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Part of the reason for this is illuminated in fascinating work by Northwestern University</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">psychologists Elizabeth Seeley and Wendi Gardner, who asked people to work on a difficult task that</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">willpower in a task like this, participants squeezed a handgrip as long as they could. The typical</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">participant was able to hold on for twenty-five seconds. But there was a group of people who were</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The participants with unusually high stamina scored high on a questionnaire measuring “other-</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">difference, proposing to pay $152 million instead of the original $54 million. Huntsman was poised</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to bring in nearly triple the original agreement. But he said no. The $54 million was good enough.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">unconventional decision. He took out a personal loan, borrowing several million dollars to make</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">there’s evidence to support this claim. The economist Arthur Brooks tested the relationship between</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">income and charitable giving</span><span class="cls_004">. Using data from almost thirty thousand Americans in the year 2000, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">controlled for every factor imaginable that would affect income and giving. He adjusted for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">education, age, race, religious involvement, political beliefs, and marital status. He also accounted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for the number of times people volunteered. As expected, higher income led to higher giving. For</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But something much more interesting happened. For every $1 in extra charitable giving, income</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was $3.75 higher. Giving actually seemed to make people richer. For example, imagine that you and I</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">gave away $900 more than I did, according to the evidence, you’ll be on track to earn $3,375 more</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">what he could get from you.” In appreciation of Peter’s services, one of his insurance clients sent him</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">started being more systematic in how I helped other people.” She started to pay more attention to who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was asking and how they treated her, and made a list of reasons to say no. To continue giving but do</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">so more efficiently, she wrote advice guides for engagement managers and associate partners, putting</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">financial success of the business. He was living on the Gold Coast of Australia, and he would spend</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was taking advantage of me, trading off the back of my loyalty to him because we had built the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Peter stayed timid until one Monday, when Rich announced that he had bought a multimillion-</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At a board meeting that day, Rich left early to meet friends at the pub. This was the last straw for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Peter; he knew Rich could no longer be trusted, so he promised the board that he would hold Rich</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accountable. But he had yet to formulate a plan—and he felt guilty and uncomfortable: “Rich was like</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">my big brother.” A colleague said, “It would have been hard for anybody, but I think it was harder</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Peter was a victim of empathy, the powerful emotion that we experience when we imagine</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">another person’s distress. Empathy is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors, but it’s also a major</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">source of vulnerability. When Brad wasn’t doing well and accepted a new job, Peter felt his pain, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bought his clients without hesitation. When he considered how Rich would feel about being ousted,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Peter felt sorry for him, and didn’t want to cut him out.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:504.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Peter was falling into an empathy trap that’s visible in a classic negotiation study. Researchers</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:576.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">profits: the strangers or the dating couples?</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">plenty of room for Rich to keep taking. Peter decided to trust but verify: he granted Rich the autonomy</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">do the same.” After six months, Rich had done very little. Peter conducted a formal analysis and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ultimately moved him on and set him free for me.” Rich elected to leave and take his equity out of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">business.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">even more of a taker than anyone realized: he had a large line of credit with the firm, and also owed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the bank money. Peter had to write a check to settle because Rich was short. A year after Peter took</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">over as managing director, Rich exited the firm. Fifteen months after Rich’s departure, Peter’s firm</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">offers a clue into how givers avoid getting burned: they become matchers in their exchanges with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">takers. It’s wise to start out as a giver, since research shows that trust is hard to build but easy to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">destroy. But once a counterpart is clearly acting like a taker, it makes sense for givers to flex their</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">competing two thirds of the time, acting cooperatively in response to one of every three defections.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">discouraging taking, without being overly punitive. It comes with a risk: generous tit for tat</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">do worse than takers, because they’re willing to give larger slices of the pie to their counterparts. But</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">family’s interests. Although he might be a doormat when he was responsible for himself, being a giver</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">meant that he didn’t want to let other people down. “I used it as a psychological weapon against</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">myself, to motivate myself,” Sameer says. “The solution was thinking about myself as an agent, an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advocate for my family. As a giver, I feel guilty about pushing too much, but the minute I start thinking,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the same time, he wasn’t pushing so far as to become a taker: he sought a balance in meeting his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">family’s interests and his company’s. “My value system means that I’m not going to do anything that’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">getting more money would harm his boss’s performance or compromise his budget. But Sameer had</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">convincing his boss to lobby HR for the bump in his salary and signing bonus. He ended up getting a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">$5,000 salary increase and a $5,000 signing bonus increase. By that time, his $10,000 signing bonus</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had expired. Sameer asked for that too, and got it. His boss assured him that this was the best he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">could do.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sameer was already up $20,000 in the first year alone, not to mention the dividends that the base</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reimbursement, so he was determined to find another way to support his family. He had plenty of free</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time during his last semester of school, so he negotiated a consulting arrangement to work for the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">company part-time. The company agreed to pay him $135 per hour, which would net Sameer another</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">$50,000 in the span of a few months. At that point, he signed the contract, having upped his total</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">compensation by more than $70,000. “Being able to keep pushing, a large part of that was being an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">agent,” Sameer says. “If I don’t push now, what’s going to happen when I get another promotion? I’m</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">motivated me to keep going. It gave me some extra cojones.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Although advocating for his family helped him succeed, Sameer was still concerned about how it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would affect his reputation at the firm and his relationship with his boss. When the negotiation was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">finished, his boss shared a surprising sentiment: he admired Sameer’s assertiveness. “It was part of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">why my boss wanted me,” Sameer says. “He respected that I wasn’t going to be pushed around</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">anymore.” Givers, particularly agreeable ones, often overestimate the degree to which assertiveness</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">might be off-putting to others. But Sameer didn’t just earn respect by virtue of negotiating; his boss</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was impressed with how he negotiated. When HR initially rejected Sameer’s request, he explained</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his family’s circumstances. “I don’t just have to worry about paying rent now. I have a family to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">support and loans to repay. Can you make this more palatable for me?” By asking on behalf of his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">family, instead of himself, Sameer was maintaining an image as a giver. He showed that he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">willing to advocate for others, which sent a positive signal about how hard he would work when</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">representing the company’s interests.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">highlights concern for the interests of others, not only oneself. When women ask for a higher salary,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they run the risk of violating expectations that they will be “other-oriented and caring, giving rather</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">than taking in character,” Babcock writes with Hannah Riley Bowles. Whereas women may be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">uniquely worried that assertiveness will violate gender norms, givers of both sexes worry about</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">violating their own reciprocity preferences. If they push too hard, they’ll feel like takers, rather than</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">givers. But when givers are advocating for someone else, pushing is closely aligned with their values</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of protecting and promoting the interests of others: givers can chalk it up to caring. And by offering</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">relational accounts, givers do more than just think of themselves as agents advocating for others; they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">present themselves as agents advocating for others, which is a powerful way to maintain their self-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">images and social images as givers.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This reasoning proved relevant to Lillian Bauer when she decided to stop letting clients treat her</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">project, she used a combination of advocacy and relational accounts. Starting with advocacy, Bauer</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">began to think about herself as an agent for the consultants on her team. “Givers have a protective</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">willing to draw a hard line.” Then, she developed a habit of articulating this responsibility to her</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">student travel agency that had purchased the record-setting package the previous year. “I’m very sorry</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to tell you this, because we love your product and value this relationship.” Michael took a deep</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">breath. “But due to budget constraints and a declining travel market, I’m not sure if we can afford to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advertise this year at all. To even consider it, we’ll need a major discount.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Knowing that many jobs depended on revenue from Michael’s company, I became an advocate</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and pushed back. Because his rivals were pulling their ads, I told Michael, it was an opportunity to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">gain a leg up on the competition—and what better time to invest than during a recession? He said he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would check with his boss and get back to me. The following week, he called with bad news: he had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">authorization to advertise in our books only if he could have the same package as the prior year, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">only with a 70 percent discount. This would slash his expenditure of just under $120,000 to below</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Let’s Go. Individual sports involved zero-sum contests where helping competitors win meant that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">I would be more likely to lose. In business, though, win-win was possible; my clients’ interests didn’t</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">might value products to give away for free in his store. I learned from colleagues that our publishing</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">psychologist Carsten De Dreu, the best negotiators weren’t takers or selfless givers. The takers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">focused on claiming value: they saw negotiations as zero-sum, win-lose contests and didn’t trust their</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">interests. By looking for opportunities to benefit others and themselves, otherish givers are able to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">helping takers, she wasn’t willing to let go of helping givers and matchers. When junior associates</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:114.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and started connecting people to help each other. Now, I’m quite explicit with my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:132.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mentees. I tell them, “People did this for me, and you need to do this for other</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:150.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people. There is an expectation that when you receive that kind of generosity</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:168.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from people, you need to pay it forward.”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">broader impact while protecting her own time. “If you have a natural mix of givers, takers, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:244.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">matchers in your company,” Bauer says, “you can do a lot to magnify the giver tendency, suppress the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:262.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">more aggressive taker tendencies, and shift the matchers toward giving. There’s an energy and a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:280.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">satisfaction that you get out of it. In its own way, it’s addictive.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:298.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Instead of assuming that they’re doomed to become doormats, successful givers recognize that</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:334.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dangers lie less in giving itself, and more in the rigidity of sticking with a single reciprocity style</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:352.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">across all interactions and relationships. As the psychologist Brian Little puts it, even if a style like</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:370.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving is our first nature, our ability to prosper depends on developing enough comfort with a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:406.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">default of trusting others’ intentions, they’re also careful to scan their environments to screen for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:442.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and flex from giving unconditionally to a more measured approach of generous tit for tat. And when</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:460.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they feel inclined to back down, successful givers are prepared to draw reserves of assertiveness</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:478.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from their commitments to the people who matter to them.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.01px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">no currency or trading allowed. The network was called </span><span class="cls_028">Freecycle</span><span class="cls_004">, and all goods had to be given</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">away for free.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The idea for Freecycle was sparked when Beal developed and ran a recycling program for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">problems with an online community that matched givers and receivers more efficiently.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Beal sent an initial e-mail announcing Freecycle to about forty friends, inviting them to join and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">spread the word. When some of the earliest Freecycle members started posting items to give away,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Beal was caught off guard. One woman offered to give away a partially used bottle of hair dye, which</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would expire in a matter of hours. “It needs to be used really soon,” she wrote, “so if anyone has an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">urge to go darker, tonight is the night.” A Texas man posted a more desirable item—fishing tackle—</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">but had a string attached. He would only give it away to someone from whom fishing tackle had been</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stolen. “As a kid thirty-four years ago, I stole a tackle box. There’s no way I can find the person and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">place on Craigslist were the optimal way of exchanging resources. By allowing people to trade value</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">back and forth, a system like Craigslist capitalizes on the fact that most people are matchers. But</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">some experts anticipated the rapid growth of systems like Freecycle, where members give to one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">person and receive from another, never trading value back and forth with the same person. These</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">researchers were convinced that although such a generalized reciprocity system relies on people to be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">givers and can be exploited by takers, it could be just as productive in facilitating the exchange of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">goods and services as direct matching.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The intuitive explanation is that the two types of systems attract different types of people. Perhaps</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:3.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">encourage matchers and takers to act like givers. To figure out how Freecycle works, Willer’s team</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the United States, measuring reciprocity styles by asking members to answer a series of questions</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about whether they generally preferred to maximize their own gains or contribute to others. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">givers had donated an average of twenty-one items on Freecycle. The takers could have given</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">nothing, but they had given away an average of more than nine items each on Freecycle.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Interestingly, in fact, people often join Freecycle to take, not give. “People usually hear about</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The answer to this question opens up another way that givers avoid the bottom of the success</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">there’s a different way for givers to make sure that they’re not being exploited: get everyone in the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and give, even if they’re more inclined to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">be takers or matchers elsewhere. This reduces the risks of giving: when everyone contributes, the pie</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:72.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">whether the decision to give can be purely altruistic, or whether it’s always ultimately selfish. Rather</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The </span><span class="cls_028">defendant of pure altruism</span><span class="cls_004"> is C. Daniel Batson, who believes that we engage in truly selfless</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving when we feel empathy for another person in need. The greater the need, and the stronger our</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:162.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">attachment to the person experiencing it, the more we empathize. When we empathize with a person,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:180.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">we focus our energy and attention on helping him or her—not because it will make us feel good but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:198.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">because we genuinely care. Batson believes that although some people feel empathy more intensely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:216.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and frequently than others, virtually all humans have the capacity for empathy—even the most</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">disagreeable of takers. As Adam Smith put it centuries ago: “the emotion which we feel for the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:252.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">misery of others . . . is by no means confined to the virtuous and humane, though they perhaps may feel</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:270.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it with the most exquisite sensibility. The greatest ruffian, the most hardened violator of the laws of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The </span><span class="cls_028">devil’s advocate</span><span class="cls_004"> is Robert Cialdini, who argues that there’s no such thing as pure altruism.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:324.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He believes that human beings are frequently generous, giving, and caring. But he doesn’t think these</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">behaviors are entirely altruistic in origin. He believes that when others hurt, we hurt—and this</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">motivates us to help. Cialdini’s first challenge to Batson’s claims was that when empathy leads us to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">help, it’s not because our ultimate goal is to benefit the other person. He proposed that when others</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">are in need, we feel distressed, sad, or guilty. To reduce our own negative feelings, we help. Cialdini</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accumulated an impressive body of studies suggesting that when people feel distressed, guilty, or sad</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">toward another person in need, they help.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Batson’s rebuttal: it’s true that people sometimes help to reduce negative feelings, but this isn’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the only reason. And negative feelings don’t always lead to helping. When we feel distressed, sad, or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guilty, our ultimate goal is to reduce these negative feelings. In some cases, helping is the strategy that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:504.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">we choose. But in many cases, we can reduce our negative feelings in other ways, such as distracting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ourselves or escaping the situation altogether. Batson figured out a clever way to tease apart whether</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">empathy drives us to help because we want to reduce another person’s distress or our own distress. If</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:558.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the goal is to reduce our own distress, we should choose whatever course of action makes us feel</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:576.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">better. If the goal is to reduce another person’s distress, we should help even when it’s costly and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:594.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">other courses of action would make us feel good.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:612.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In one experiment, Batson and colleagues gave people a choice: watch a woman receive electric</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:630.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shocks or leave the experiment to avoid the distress. Not surprisingly, 75 percent left. But when they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">felt empathy for the woman, only 14 percent left; the other 86 percent stayed and offered to take the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shocks in her place. And of the people who stayed to help, the ones who empathized the most strongly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:684.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were willing to endure four times as many shocks as those who felt less empathy. Batson and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">colleagues demonstrated this pattern in more than half a dozen experiments. Even when people can</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reduce their negative feelings by escaping the situation, if they’re feeling empathy, they stay and help</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:738.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">anyway, at a personal cost of time and pain. On the basis of this evidence, Batson concluded that</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that empathy can drive helping. Feelings of concern and compassion certainly motivate us to act for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the benefit of others at a personal cost. But he wasn’t convinced that this reflects pure altruism. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">argued that when we empathize with a victim in need, we become so emotionally attached that we</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">experience a sense of oneness with the victim. We merge the victim into our sense of self. We see</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">more of ourselves in the victim. And this is why we help: we’re really helping ourselves. Quoting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Adam Smith again, “By the imagination we place ourselves in his situation, we conceive ourselves</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enduring all the same torments, we enter as it were into his body, and become in some measure the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cialdini and colleagues conducted numerous experiments supporting this idea. Empathy leads to a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sense of oneness, or self-other overlap, and this leads to greater helping. Batson’s team came back</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with another rebuttal: that </span><span class="cls_005">is</span><span class="cls_004"> altruism. If we empathize with other people to the point of merging our</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">own identities with theirs, we care about them as much as we care about ourselves. Because we no</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Both camps agree that empathy leads to helping. Both camps agree that a sense of oneness is a key</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reason why. But they fundamentally differ about whether oneness is selfish or altruistic. I believe</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">there’s a middle ground here, and it’s one that Deron Beal discovered early on. When he started</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them. But he also had some personal interests at stake. In his recycling program, he had a warehouse</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">full of stuff he couldn’t use or recycle, and his boss wanted the warehouse emptied. In addition, Beal</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was hoping to get rid of an old mattress that he owned. None of his friends needed it, and it was too</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">big to throw away. To dump it, he would need to borrow a truck and drive the mattress to a landfill,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">where he would be charged for disposal. Beal realized it would be easier and cheaper if he could</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">just give it away to someone on Freecycle.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This is why many takers and matchers started giving on Freecycle. It’s an efficient way to get rid</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of things they don’t want and probably can’t sell on Craigslist. But soon, Beal knows from personal</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">experience, people who initially give things away for selfish reasons begin to care about the people</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they’re helping. When the recipient arranged to pick up his mattress, Beal was thrilled. “I thought I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was getting away with giving a mattress away, that I was the one benefiting,” he says. “But when the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">person showed up at my door and thanked me, I felt good. It was only partially a selfish act: I was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">helping someone else in a way that made me happy. I felt so darn good about it that I started giving</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">executives were unmoved. “We like your proposal,” one executive said, “but we can’t trust you. Why</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:594.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">followed suit, putting the soccer scarves around their necks.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:612.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Nouveau executives were surprised. They asked which partner would take the lead on the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A few hours later, Phillippe’s firm landed the project.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:684.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Nouveau executives had not known that Phillippe was from their city. “This was a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reorganization task,” Phillippe explains, “and having someone care about this city, and the people</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Freecycle members, they were interested in the degree to which each group experienced</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">identification and cohesion. The more members identified, the more they saw Craigslist or Freecycle</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">experience greater identification and cohesion with Craigslist or Freecycle?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The answer depends on how much a member has received from the site. For members who</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">who received or bought many items, there were stark differences: members reported substantially</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">greater identification and cohesion with Freecycle than Craigslist. This was true even after</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accounting for members’ tendencies toward giving: regardless of whether they were givers or not,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">members who participated frequently felt more attached to Freecycle than to Craigslist. Why would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people feel more identified and connected with a community where they give freely rather than</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">matching evenly?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Willer’s team argues that for two central reasons receiving is a fundamentally different</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">experience in generalized giving and direct matching systems. The first distinction lies in the terms of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the exchange. In direct matching, the exchange is an economic transaction. When members buy an item</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on Craigslist, they know that sellers are typically trying to maximize their own gains with little</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">concern for buyers’ interests. In contrast, in generalized giving, givers aren’t getting anything tangible</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">back from the recipients. When members receive an item on Freecycle, they’re accepting a gift from a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giver with no strings attached. According to Willer’s team, this “suggests that the giver is motivated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to act in the interest of the recipient rather than in his or her own self-interest,” which “communicates</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a regard for the recipient beyond the instrumental value attached to the item itself.” In comparison</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with an economic transaction, a gift is value-laden.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The second distinction has to do with who’s responsible for the benefits you receive. When you</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">buy on Craigslist, if you receive an item at a good price, you can chalk it up to your savvy as a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">negotiator or the kindness (or naïveté) of an individual seller. You’re exchanging back and forth with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">another individual; you’re not getting anything from the Craigslist community. “As a result,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">participants in direct exchange will be less inclined to identify with the group because they will be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">less likely to derive the emotional experience of group membership,” Willer’s team writes. In</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">generalized giving, on the other hand, the community is the source of the gifts you receive. An</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">effective system of generalized giving typically involves cycles of exchange with the following</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:108.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they saw him give, he was a member of their unique community, so they felt more compelled to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:126.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">follow his example. New York University psychologist Jonathan Haidt refers to this as </span><span class="cls_030">elevation</span><span class="cls_004">, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">warm feeling of being moved by others’ acts of giving, which can “seem to push a mental ‘reset</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:288.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">likely to volunteer as the Superman group. Three months later, Nelson and Norton invited both groups</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:306.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to a meeting to kick off their volunteering. The people who had written about a superhero were four</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:378.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When people think about the general attributes of superheroes, they generate a list of desirable</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">characteristics that they can relate to themselves. In the study, for example, people wrote about how</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">superheroes are helpful and responsible, and they wanted to express these giver values, so they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">volunteered. But when people think specifically about Superman, what comes to mind is a set of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">impossible standards, like those popularized in the TV series </span><span class="cls_005">The Adventures of Superman: </span><span class="cls_004">“faster</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thousands of dollars for charity, they expected that they would need to solicit donations from an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">average of 210 people to meet their fund-raising goals, anticipating an average donation under $50.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">costs of saying no. It’s uncomfortable, guilt-provoking, and embarrassing to turn down a small request</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for help. And psychological research points to another factor—equally powerful, and deeply rooted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in American culture—that causes people to believe there aren’t many givers around them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Workplaces and schools are often designed to be zero-sum environments, with forced rankings</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">settings, it’s </span><span class="cls_028">only natural to assume</span><span class="cls_004"> that peers will lean in the taker direction, so people hold back on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving. This reduces the actual amount of giving that occurs, leading people to underestimate the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">number of people who are interested in giving. Over time, because giving appears to be uncommon,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people with giver values begin to feel that they’re in the minority.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As a result, even when they do engage in giving behaviors, people worry that they’ll isolate</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">themselves socially if they violate the norm, so they disguise their giving behind purely self-interested</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">motives. As early as 1835, after visiting the United States from France, the social philosopher Alexis</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">de Tocqueville wrote that Americans “enjoy </span><span class="cls_028">explaining almost every act of their lives on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_028"><span class="cls_028">principle of self-interest</span><span class="cls_004">.” He saw Americans “help one another” and “freely give part of their time</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and wealth for the good of the state,” but was struck by the fact that “Americans are hardly prepared</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to admit” that these acts were driven by a genuine desire to help others. “I think that in this way they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">often do themselves less than justice,” he wrote. A century and a half later, the Princeton sociologist</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Robert Wuthnow interviewed a wide range of Americans who chose helping professions, from</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cardiologists to rescue workers. When he asked them to explain why they did good deeds, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">referenced self-interested reasons, such as “I liked the people I was working with” or “It gets me out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of the house.” They didn’t want to admit that they were genuinely helpful, kind, generous, caring, or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">compassionate. “We have </span><span class="cls_028">social norms against sounding too charitable</span><span class="cls_004">,” Wuthnow writes, such that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“we call people who go around acting too charitable ‘bleeding hearts,’ ‘do-gooders.’”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In my experience, this is what happens in many businesses and universities: plenty of people hold</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giver values, but suppress or disguise them under the mistaken assumption that their peers don’t share</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">these values. As the psychologists David Krech and Richard Crutchfield explained many years ago,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this creates a situation where “</span><span class="cls_028">no one believes</span><span class="cls_004">, but everyone thinks that everyone believes.” Consider</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:759.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">assume that others don’t, the whole norm in a group or a company can shift away from giving. “</span><span class="cls_028">Ideas</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">writes the psychologist Barry Schwartz. “These effects can arise because sometimes when people act</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on the basis of ideology, they inadvertently arrange the very conditions that bring reality into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">correspondence with the ideology.” When people assume that others aren’t givers, they act and speak</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in ways that discourage others from giving, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As a structured form of giving, the Reciprocity Ring is designed to disrupt this self-fulfilling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">prophecy. The first step is to make sure that people ask for help. Research shows that at work, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">vast majority of giving that occurs between people is in response to direct requests for help. In one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">study, managers described times when they gave and received help. Of all the giving exchanges that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">occurred, roughly 90 percent were initiated by the recipient asking for help. Yet when we have a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">need, we’re often reluctant to ask for help. Much of the time, we’re embarrassed: we don’t want to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">look incompetent or needy, and we don’t want to burden others. As one Wharton dean explains, “The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">students call it Game Face: they feel pressured to look successful all the time. There can’t be any</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chinks in their armor, and opening up would make them vulnerable.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the Reciprocity Ring, because everyone is making a request, there’s little reason to be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">embarrassed. By making requests explicit and specific, participants provide potential givers with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">clear direction about how to contribute effectively. As in Freecycle, the Reciprocity Ring often starts</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with givers stepping up as role models for contributions. But in every Reciprocity Ring, there are</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">likely to be many matchers and some people who prefer to operate as takers. For a generalized giving</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">system to achieve sustainable effectiveness, as in Freecycle, these matchers and takers need to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">contribute. Otherwise, the givers will end up helping everyone while receiving little in return, placing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">themselves at risk for getting burned or burning out. Do matchers and takers step up?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Because people often present meaningful requests in Reciprocity Rings, many matchers are drawn</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in by empathy. When I heard a powerful CEO’s voice tremble as he sought advice and connections to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wanted to help,” one financial services executive confides. “My job requires me to be very task-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">focused and financially oriented. I didn’t expect to care that much, especially about a stranger I’d</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">never met. But I really felt for his need, and wanted to do whatever I could to contribute and fulfill his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Even when they don’t empathize, matchers still end up making plenty of contributions. It’s very</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">difficult to act like a pure matcher in the </span><span class="cls_028">Reciprocity Ring</span><span class="cls_004">, since it’s unlikely that the people you help</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">will be the same people who can help fulfill your request. So the easiest way to be a matcher is to try</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to contribute the same amount that other people do. The Reciprocity Ring creates a miniature version</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">contributions, even to people who haven’t helped them directly. By giving more than they take,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">participants amplify the odds that everyone in the group will have their requests fulfilled, much like</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about it. For the first time in the university’s four centuries, Harvard freshmen were invited to sign a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pledge to serve society. The pledge concluded: “As we begin at Harvard, we commit to upholding the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">values of the College and to making the entryway and Yard a place where all can thrive and where the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">exercise of kindness holds a place on a par with intellectual attainment.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Believing in the power of a public commitment, Dingman decided to go one step beyond inviting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:486.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">students to sign the pledge. To encourage students to follow through, their signatures would be framed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:504.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in the hallways of campus dorms. A storm of objections quickly emerged, most notably from Harry</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Lewis, a computer science professor and the former dean of Harvard College. “An appeal for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:558.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this community is too often wanting,” he wrote on his blog, but “for Harvard to ‘invite’ people to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">effect on Harvard students. When they sign the pledge, they establish credentials as givers, which may</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving is important, and then they’ll give. But according to a rich body of psychological detective</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:650.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">businesses. They were overfishing to the point that the resource would become extinct, and they sat</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:668.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down to discuss how they should handle the dilemma. One negotiator suggested that they should split</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:686.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the maximum total fishing in four equal parts. Another proposed a different way of matching based on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:704.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">equity rather than equality: since some of them were running larger operations than others, they should</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">each reduce their fishing by 50 percent. They all agreed that this was a fair solution, and the meeting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:740.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was adjourned. Now, it was up to each negotiator to make an individual decision about whether to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:758.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">honor the agreement and how much to fish.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:3.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Two of the negotiators stuck to their commitments, reducing their fishing by 50 percent. The third</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">operated like a giver: she reduced her fishing by 65 percent. The group was all set to keep the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">resource intact, but Derek chose not to reduce his fishing at all. He took as much as he could, actually</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">increasing his fishing total and decimating the other three entrepreneurs. Before the group met, Derek</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had the lowest profits of the four. After he took far more than his share of the harvest, his profits were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">70 percent higher than the giver’s and 31 percent higher than those of the other two. When confronted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">by his colleagues, Derek responded, “I wanted to win the negotiations and destroy my competitors.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Just a few months later, Derek began a meteoric rise in his career. He was hired by a professional</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sports team and established a reputation as a dominant negotiator, playing a key role in assembling a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">team that went on to win a world championship. Derek was promoted in an unusually short period of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time and recognized as one of the one hundred most powerful people in his sport—while still in his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thirties.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Derek first started working for his team as a professional negotiator, his job was to manage</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the budget, identify top prospects, and negotiate contracts with agents to sign new players and keep</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">existing players. Since resources were tight, bargaining like a taker would work to his advantage.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Derek began to search for underrated talent, and stumbled upon a gem of a player in the minor</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">leagues. He sat down with the player’s agent to negotiate a contract. True to form, Derek made a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lowball offer. The agent was frustrated: several comparable players were earning higher salaries.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The agent accused Derek of pushing him around and demanded more money, but Derek ignored the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">demands and didn’t budge. Eventually, the agent gave in and agreed to Derek’s terms. It was a win for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Derek, saving his team thousands of dollars.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But when Derek went home that night, he had an uneasy feeling. “I could just feel through the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conversation that he was pretty upset. He brought up a couple points on comparable players, and in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the heat of things, I probably wasn’t listening too much. He was going away with a bad taste in his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mouth.” Derek decided he didn’t want to end the exchange with the agent on a sour note. So he tore up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the contract and met the agent’s original request, giving him thousands of extra dollars for the player.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Was this a wise decision? Derek was costing his team money, and potentially creating a precedent</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for doing so in other negotiations. Besides, the deal was settled. The agent had agreed to the lowball</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">offer and Derek had achieved his goal. Going back on it hardly seemed like a smart move.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Actually, it was much smarter than it first appeared. When Vanderbilt researchers Bruce Barry</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Ray Friedman studied negotiations, they had a hunch that sharper negotiators would get better</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">results, as they could gather and analyze more information, keep track of multiple issues, and generate</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hidden solutions. In one study, Barry and Friedman obtained data on the intelligence of nearly a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hundred MBA students. They measured intelligence using each student’s score on the GMAT, a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rigorous test that is widely used in business school admissions to measure quantitative, verbal, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">analytical abilities. The participants negotiated in pairs, playing either the developer of a new mall or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the representative of a potential store to anchor the mall. After they finished negotiating, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">submitted their final agreements, and two experts assessed the value of the deal to each party.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As expected, the joint gains were highest when both parties were very intelligent. Barry and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Friedman broke down each party’s gains, expecting to find that the </span><span class="cls_028">smarter negotiators</span><span class="cls_004"> got better</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">deals for themselves. But they didn’t. The brightest negotiators got better deals </span><span class="cls_005">for their</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:21.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">more intelligent you are, the more you help your counterpart succeed. This is exactly what Derek did</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">when he gave the agent more money for the minor league player. He was giving in an otherish way</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:57.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that was low cost to him but high benefit to the agent and the player. A few thousand dollars was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">small potatoes to his team, but very significant to the player.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">What drove Derek to shift in the giver direction? Shortly before the negotiation with the agent,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Derek had gained a window into something that mattered deeply to him: his reputation. At the end of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:129.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the negotiation course, every participant submitted votes for negotiation awards. Derek received zero</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:147.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">votes for Most Cooperative, zero for Most Creative, and zero for Most Ethical. In fact, there was only</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:165.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one award for which he received any votes. For this particular award, Derek received the vast</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:183.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">majority of the votes. He was the landslide winner for Most Ruthless.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:201.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But Derek achieved something more memorable that week. He became the only student in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:219.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">business school history to be voted the Most Ruthless negotiator </span><span class="cls_005">in a class that he never took</span><span class="cls_004">. At the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:237.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">same time that he was enrolled in his course, another negotiation class was under way. None of these</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:255.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">students in the other class ever sat across the bargaining table from Derek. Some of them had never</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">met him. Yet his reputation spread so quickly that they voted for him as Most Ruthless anyway.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Derek was negotiating the way any reasonable person would in a taker’s world. As a professional</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:309.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">athlete, he had learned that if he didn’t claim as much value as possible, he was at risk for becoming a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">doormat. “It was the team against the player. The team was always trying to take money out of my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pocket, so I viewed a negotiation to be a combative process, which produced a winner and a loser,”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Derek says. “I had to try to take more and more.” After being anointed the Most Ruthless negotiator</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">by his peers—and a group of strangers—Derek began to reflect on his reciprocity style at the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bargaining table. “While I gained a short-term benefit by taking, in the long run I paid. My</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">relationship with a colleague was ruined, and it caused the demise of my reputation,” he said. In the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">negotiation with the agent, when he ripped up the contract and gave the agent more money, “It built</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">goodwill. The agent was extremely appreciative,” Derek reflects. “When the player came up for free</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">agency, the agent gave me a call. Looking back on it now, I’m really glad I did it. It’s definitely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:489.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">improved our relationship, and helped out our organization. Maybe Most Ruthless is maturing.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:507.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Actually, I believe maturing is the wrong way to describe Derek’s transformation. Maturation</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">implies a process of growth and development, but in a sense, Derek was actually taking a step</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:543.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">backward to express core values that he had embraced for years away from the bargaining table. Long</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:561.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">before he ever negotiated like a taker, his peers perceived him as a generous, helpful person who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would make time for anyone who asked. He spent countless hours providing advice to colleagues</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">who were interested in sports management careers and mentoring young athletes who aspired to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:615.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">follow in his footsteps. Growing up, he was elected captain of virtually every team on which he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">played, from elementary school through high school, all the way through college. He even became</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">captain as a rookie on his first professional team—players twice his age respected his commitment to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:669.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">putting the team’s interests ahead of his own.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:687.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At the bargaining table, Derek’s transition wasn’t about learning a new set of values. It was about</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">developing the confidence and courage to express an old set of values in a new domain. I believe this</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:723.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">is true for most people who operate like matchers professionally, and my hope is that others like</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Derek won’t wait for a Most Ruthless award to start finding ways to act in the interest of others at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:759.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">work. For Derek these days, a signature form of giving is helping opposing teams gather information</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:75.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to his shift from taking toward giving. Yet he still worries about what will happen if people outside</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:93.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his inner circle find out about his shift in the giver direction. In fact, Derek Sorenson is a pseudonym:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:111.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">before sharing his story, he asked me to disguise his identity. “I don’t want it to get out there that I’ve</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">realization that all of her professional role models were givers. Suddenly, her frame of reference</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">top. This isn’t what we usually notice when we glance up at the horizon at successful people. By and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to dominate the spotlight. But if you start paying attention to reciprocity styles in your own workplace,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">I have a hunch that you’ll discover plenty of givers achieving the success to which you aspire.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:27.49px;top:576.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The verdict was nearly unanimous: givers. When I asked who rises to the top, the students were</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:612.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">heretical. “You might be underestimating the success of givers,” I told them. It’s true that some people</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:117.00px" class="cls_006"><span class="cls_006">had a trick up their sleeves. In another version of the study, instead of writing about why they loved Manchester United, the fans wrote</span></div>
